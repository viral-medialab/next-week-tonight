`Return a comprensive list of all the unique hypotheses, claims and statistics about the topic: ${topicTitle} that the content below contains. Note, each hypothesis should be independent and be able to read individually without the context of the other hypotheses, that is, do not use any pronouns or words that refer back to other hypotheses. Make the hypotheses as conjectures that could be inferred from reading the content. For example, if the article states critics say happiness may be linked to socioeconomic status then the resulting hypothesis that can be inferred is "happiness is linked to socioeconomic status. Additionally, only make facts about the topic or primary data. More specifically, make facts that can be compared across multiple sources about the same topic. Do not for example make a fact that begins by saying X said that Y unless X is an individual in the primary data of the topic. Rather make a fact that states Y directly even if it is an opinion. Facts do not need to be true, they just need to be supported by the content true or untrue.`
