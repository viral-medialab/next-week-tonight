Here is a summary of the article “4 ways a US debt default could affect you — and your money” from the World Economic Forum[1]:

## Overview

The United States faced the risk of defaulting on its debt due to a stalemate in raising the debt ceiling. This situation posed severe dangers not only to the US economy but also to the global financial system, as the US dollar serves as the world’s primary reserve currency. Experts warned that the consequences of a default could be catastrophic. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated a default would cause severe hardship for American families, damage US global leadership, and raise doubts about its national security commitments.

## How a US Debt Default Could Affect Consumers

The article outlines four key ways a US debt default could impact everyday people:

- A default would likely trigger a decline in US real GDP, with Moody’s analysis predicting a 4.6% reduction by the end of 2023 in the event of a prolonged default.
- Economic disruptions would extend beyond the US, impacting consumers and markets globally.
- Essential US government services (such as military salaries and healthcare benefits) could be disrupted, as the government would be unable to cover its obligations.
- The global economy would be destabilized, with increased borrowing costs and uncertainty due to the loss of confidence in the US government’s financial reliability.

In summary, a US debt default could cause severe and widespread economic harm, affecting everything from government services to global markets and family financial security[1].
