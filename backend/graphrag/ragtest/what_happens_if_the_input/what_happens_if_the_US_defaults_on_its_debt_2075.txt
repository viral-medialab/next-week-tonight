Here is a summary of the article "What are the risks of a rising federal debt?" from the Brookings Institution:

The article addresses the mounting concerns over the rapid growth of U.S. federal debt relative to the size of the economy—a level not seen since World War II. Without significant changes in tax and spending laws, projections show the debt will continue to climb indefinitely. The current tax structure is insufficient to cover rising costs, especially retirement and healthcare promises to an aging population. Despite this, the U.S. government has managed to borrow at moderate interest rates by historical standards. However, analysts warn that if debt accumulation continues unchecked, it could eventually trigger a crisis[1].

**Main Risks and Consequences:**

- Persistently rising federal debt that outpaces economic growth means future generations will be worse off than they would be if debt growth were slower[1].
- Most of today's borrowing is used to finance current consumption, benefiting today’s generations at the expense of future ones[1].
- Higher debt levels will likely push up interest rates and lead to "crowding out," where increased government borrowing limits private investment[1].
- Less private investment results in slower productivity growth, reducing the potential rise in living standards for future generations, even if overall economic growth continues[1].

**Crisis Likelihood:**

- The possibility of a sudden fiscal crisis in the U.S. remains low, given the nation’s strong institutions and history, so long as the fiscal trajectory does not worsen drastically[5].
- The greater risk is a gradual erosion of national wealth and a reduction in capital stock, undermining future prosperity[3].
- Risks of a crisis could increase if there are political missteps or if demand for U.S. Treasury securities shifts suddenly, driving up interest rates and destabilizing debt markets[5].

**Conclusion:**

In summary, while a severe debt crisis is not seen as imminent, rising federal debt poses real economic risks for future generations through slower growth, higher interest payments, and lower living standards than otherwise possible. The article cautions that responsible fiscal policy is needed to mitigate these long-term risks and keep the federal debt on a more sustainable path[1][3][5].
