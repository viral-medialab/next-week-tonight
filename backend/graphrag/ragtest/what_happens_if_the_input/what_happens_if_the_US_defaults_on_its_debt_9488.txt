The article "Default Would Have a Catastrophic Impact on the Economy" from the Center for American Progress discusses the severe repercussions a U.S. debt default would have, as agreed upon by economic experts across the political spectrum[1]. The primary points outlined include:

- A default on U.S. government obligations would likely trigger a catastrophic economic downturn, both domestically and globally.  
- A default would shake confidence in the reliability of U.S. Treasury bonds, undermine economic progress, and risk plunging the nation into recession[1][2].
- Financial markets would experience dramatic declines, household wealth could be significantly reduced, and the effects would ripple out to negatively impact trade and financial systems worldwide[1][2].
- The article stresses that the consequences would not be limited to the United States; global financial stability would be at risk due to the central role of U.S. government debt in world markets[1][2].

In summary, the article cautions that failing to meet the nation's fiscal obligations would have dire and far-reaching impacts on economic stability and growth, warning policymakers and the public of the immense risks involved[1][2].
