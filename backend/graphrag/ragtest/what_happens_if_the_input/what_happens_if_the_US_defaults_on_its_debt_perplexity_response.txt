If the United States defaults on its debt—meaning it fails to pay its creditors on time—the effects would be severe and far-reaching, impacting not just the U.S. economy but also causing turmoil globally.

## Immediate Economic and Financial Impact

- **Global Financial Crisis**: A total U.S. debt default would likely trigger a global financial crisis since U.S. Treasuries are a foundational asset in the world economy and are widely regarded as risk-free. The ripple effect would destabilize financial markets worldwide[1][4].
- **Rising Interest Rates**: Investors would see U.S. government debt as riskier, demanding higher interest rates before lending money to the Treasury. This would quickly cascade to higher rates for mortgages, auto loans, and other forms of credit for businesses and consumers[2][4][5].
- **Stock Market Crash**: A default would likely cause a sharp drop in stock markets. Estimates suggest the stock market could fall by as much as 45%, rapidly erasing trillions of dollars in household wealth and retirement savings[5].
- **Credit Rating Downgrade**: The U.S. credit rating would almost certainly be downgraded, increasing borrowing costs for the government and private sector, while eroding confidence in U.S. financial leadership[4].
- **Immediate Government Payment Disruptions**: The U.S. Treasury would be unable to make timely payments for federal obligations, including Social Security, Medicare, military salaries, tax refunds, and interest on the national debt. This would disrupt individual and business finances across the country[4].

## Broader Economic Fallout

- **Recession**: According to analyses by Moody’s and the White House Council of Economic Advisers, a prolonged default could plunge the U.S. economy into a recession, with the country’s GDP shrinking by up to 6% and widespread job losses[3][5].
- **Soaring Unemployment**: The sharp economic contraction would send unemployment rates higher, reminiscent of the downturn seen in the global financial crisis of 2008[3][5].
- **Government Paralysis**: During a breach-induced recession, the federal government would lack both the fiscal flexibility and political ability to deliver emergency economic relief, worsening the effects of the downturn[5].

## International and Long-Term Consequences

- **Global Market Turmoil**: Faith in the U.S. dollar and Treasury securities underpins much of global finance. A default would undermine the U.S. dollar’s reserve currency status and disrupt global trade and investment flows[4][5].
- **Higher Costs for U.S. Borrowing**: To sell debt after a default, the U.S. would have to offer higher yields, costing taxpayers more and making it harder to finance government operations and future borrowing[4][5].
- **Loss of Investor Confidence**: A default would signal to global and domestic investors that U.S. debt can no longer be considered risk-free, fundamentally altering global investment patterns and increasing instability[1][4].
