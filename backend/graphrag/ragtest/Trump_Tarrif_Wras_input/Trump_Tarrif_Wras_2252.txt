# China has seemingly called Donald Trump's bluff on tariffs, to the delight of markets

The trade war between the US and China isn't fully over, but a deal between the two sides to slash reciprocal tariffs is a major capitulation from Donald Trump.

After ratcheting up tariffs on Chinese imports to an astonishing 145 per cent, he's now agreed to drop them to 30 per cent.

Trump had long claimed America holds the whip hand in negotiations, luridly stating countries are "kissing my arse" to secure trade deals.

He had gone as far as to assert the world's biggest economy didn't even need to trade with other countries — that it could produce everything its people need.

It seems that may not be the case.

### Trump claims 'reset' with China following tariff agreement

The US president says he could speak to China's President Xi Jinping by the end of the week, after the two countries agreed to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs.

Trump was conscious that the cost of the eye-watering tariffs was about to really bite at home.

Up until now, the true cost of the tariffs hasn't been exposed because companies were able to draw down on stock they'd purchased pre-tariff hikes — but that stock wasn't going to last forever.

There were warnings that Americans would soon start to see empty shelves when they went shopping.

Trump may claim to be a master negotiator, but it's unclear what he's got out of this deal.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is striking a much more conciliatory tone than his boss about it all.

After meeting with the Chinese, he said: "The consensus from both delegations is that neither side wanted a decoupling."

There have been no real concessions from the Chinese side despite Trump's repeated claims they were "ripping off" America.

Yes, Beijing has also lowered its tax on US goods to 10 per cent from 125 per cent, but they'd only imposed those tariffs in retaliation for America striking first.

China appears to have called Trump's bluff.

## Who called the meeting?

Since the Liberation Day trade announcement, Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed the Chinese were desperately trying to negotiate a deal.

He provided no substantive details about these requests. And the Chinese have categorically stated that no such requests were being made.

Ahead of this weekend's meeting in Switzerland, Beijing wanted to make it crystal clear who had asked for the talks.

"The meeting is being held at the request of the US side," declared Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian.

Trump tried to downplay the importance of who was the requester versus the requested.

"We can all play games — who made the first call, who didn't make them. Doesn't matter," Trump said.

Take of that what you will.

What seems clear is that China was willing to bet it could withstand the pressure of tariffs better than the US could.

## China stands firm

The tariffs were certainly hurting China's economy.

America is a massive market for their products, and a 145 per cent tax on their goods was an effective embargo of trade.

China's leadership, however, doesn't need to be as sensitive to public opinion as Trump's.

They know US public discontent is quickly picked up both by polling numbers and by members of Congress hearing directly from their constituents.

Polls were already suggesting American discontent with the way their president was handling the economy, while members of Congress had fiery town hall meetings.

Trump may be banned by the Constitution from running for a third term, but he still has a strong interest in Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress after the midterm elections, held next year.

China's leadership faces no such democratic reckoning. They could withstand pressure longer than Trump could.

## Trump capitulation a positive sign for investors

Trump's first major step-down was when he put in place a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on all countries except China.

At the time of that pause, he said it was because people were getting "yippy".

Now he has put a pause on the reciprocal tariffs on China too.

Investors were buoyed by the announcement because they have taken it as further evidence that Trump isn't as wedded to a high-tariff regime as he claimed on Liberation Day.

But in both cases, Trump has kept the 10 per cent "baseline" tariff in place.

China is also facing a 20 per cent punitive tariff for what Trump says is its role in the manufacturing and distribution of the drug fentanyl.

Last week, the president announced a trade "deal" with the UK, the first since the reciprocal tariffs were put in place.

While Trump claimed it as a "maxed-out deal", once you scratch the surface, it looked more like a deal to make a deal in the future.

Yes, the UK is now able to sell 100,000 new vehicles into the US at a 10 per cent tax, instead of the 25 per cent tariff most countries now face when selling cars.

There are also concessions for steel and aluminium, but the UK hasn't managed to negotiate away the 10 per cent baseline tariff.

## Tariff lessons for Australia and others

Evidence is now mounting that the 10 per cent tariff really is here to stay.

If that's the case, it means there's little incentive for countries like Australia, which is only facing the baseline 10 per cent tariff, to negotiate any deal with Trump.

Unlike the UK, Australia doesn't have a local car industry to protect.

Yes, some relief from the steel and aluminium tariffs would be beneficial to the companies and people involved in those sectors.

But Australia won't want to be trading off things like biosecurity or access to cheaper generic medicines to gain those benefits.

What may well shake out of Trump's tariffs is a series of deals with individual countries for slightly increased American access to markets — which Trump will herald as major achievements.

Trump may have overreached with his inflated tariff on China, but investors should be careful about overreacting.

A 30 per cent tariff on Chinese goods is still going to hurt American consumers, and it doesn't look like the baseline tariff is going anywhere anytime soon.
