The full plain text content of the URL could not be directly extracted from the search results. However, here is a detailed summary of the "Research Projects" page at the Center for AI Safety (CAIS):

The Center for AI Safety (CAIS) conducts research focusing on mitigating high-consequence, societal-scale risks associated with artificial intelligence. Their work encompasses both technical and conceptual research across multiple disciplines, such as safety engineering, complex systems, international relations, and philosophy, with the goal of advancing foundational benchmarks and frameworks for understanding technical and societal AI risks.

**Key features of their research approach and projects:**

- CAIS's technical research aims to improve the safety of current AI systems by identifying and addressing concrete hazards, monitoring AI behaviors, steering AI system alignment, and reducing deployment risks.
- Their conceptual research explores strategic challenges, including the risks posed by superintelligent AI from a national security perspective, suggesting strategies like deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness enhancement.
- CAIS has published papers offering frameworks and roadmaps for machine learning safety, highlighting problems such as robustness, monitoring, alignment, and systemic safety.
- Their research analyzes long-term and speculative risks, applying hazard analysis concepts to enhance immediate and future AI safety, and investigates how Darwinian selection pressures could produce AI agents with undesirable traits, proposing interventions to counteract these risks.
- CAIS also addresses catastrophic risks stemming from advanced AI, categorizing dangers as malicious use, competitive race dynamics, organizational failures, and rogue AI behaviors. They provide mitigation strategies, ideal scenarios, and illustrative stories for each hazard.
- Empirical evidence and multidisciplinary perspectives underpin CAIS's approach, and their studies examine topics such as the likelihood of AI deception, regulatory measures, bot identification, and broader societal impacts[1].

The page lists various researchers involved and provides brief descriptions of individual research papers, emphasizing their efforts to outline both concrete and conceptual paths for ensuring AI systems are developed and deployed safely for societal benefit[1].
