_UPDATE (April 11, 2025):_ _China’s State Council Tariff Commission announced it will raise tariffs on US imports from 84 percent to 125 percent, effective April 12, matching the US’s reciprocal tariff on Chinese goods implemented a day earlier. The announcement also noted that as US exports to China are no longer viable under current tariffs, China will not respond to future tariff hikes. However, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Li Jian reiterated that China is prepared to “fight to the end” if tensions escalate, while advocating for dialogue based on mutual respect._

_UPDATE (April 10, 2025): In a dramatic shift, President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on planned tariff hikes for most countries, citing a cooperative response from over 75 trading partners. The decision marks a temporary easing in the ongoing trade war that has rattled global markets. However, China was excluded from the tariff pause. Trump blamed Beijing’s retaliatory actions — including hiking the tariff rate to 84 percent — and announced an immediate increase in US duties on Chinese imports to 125 percent, on top of the 20 percent rate the president had previously imposed on China — bringing the total tariff to 145 percent. The US administration indicated openness to talks with other nations but reinforced its hardline stance on China, signaling further uncertainty in global trade dynamics._

_UPDATE (April 9, 2025): President Trump signed an executive order raising the reciprocal tariff rate on China from 34 percent to 84 percent, bringing the final rate to 104 percent. The additional 50 percent rate was implemented after China did not repeal the 34 percent duty it placed on US goods by April 8, as Trump had demanded. The 104 percent tariff, along with the reciprocal tariff rates placed on other countries, came into effect on Wednesday, April 9. In addition to the tariff hike, the executive order tripled the de minimis duty rate on parcels valued under US$800 arriving from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong to 90 percent, and the per-item fee to US$75 from May 1, rising to US$150 from June 1. On the same day, China’s Ministry of Finance raised the tariff on US goods to 84 percent, effective April 10._

On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on global trade partners, citing a “national emergency” caused by unfair foreign trade practices. The new measures include a universal 10 percent “minimum base tariff” on all imported goods – fulfilling one of his key campaign promises – along with higher reciprocal tariffs targeting the US’s largest trading partners. China faces one of the steepest tariffs, with Trump initially imposing an additional 34 percent duty on top of the existing 20 percent tariff introduced in two rounds earlier this year.

On April 9, 2025, Trump announced an immediate increase in US duties on Chinese imports to 125 percent on top of the 20 percent rate the president had previously put on goods coming from China, which means that China now faces a minimum tariff rate of 145 percent on all exports to the United States. This came hours after China retaliated with additional 50 percent tariff on US goods, matching the US’s previous tariff rate. The universal 10 percent tariff took effect on April 5, while the additional 145 percent tariff (initially 104 percent) on China was implemented on April 9. The reciprocal tariffs imposed on a range of other countries were also set to take effect on April 9, but were given a 90-day reprieve.

Trump framed the initial 34 percent tariff as a “discounted rate,” stating it is half of the 67 percent rate that China allegedly “charges” the US. The reciprocal tariffs are the latest in an escalating series of trade measures taken by the Trump administration against major trade partners, including tariffs on global steel, aluminum, and automobile imports. More tariffs are expected in the near future. A senior administration official told Reuters that additional duties are being considered on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and possibly critical minerals.

## 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods

The 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports follows a gradual escalation in duties levied on Chinese goods since Trump took office. In February and March, Trump raised the tariff rate on all Chinese goods to 20 percent, first implementing a 10 percent tariff, effective February 4, and then raising it by another 10 percent a month later.

On April 8, he signed an executive order (EO) raising the reciprocal tariff from 34 percent to 84 percent, and a day later announced the rate would rise further to 145 percent, effective immediately. Certain products will not be subject to the reciprocal tariffs, namely:

1. Articles subject to 50 USC 1702(b), such as personal transfers of goods without value, donations, information or informational materials, and personal items transported during personal travel;
2. Steel and aluminum articles and autos/auto parts already subject to Section 232 tariffs (meaning the rate on these products will remain at 25 percent);
3. Copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber articles;
4. All articles that may become subject to future Section 232 tariffs;
5. Bullion; and
6. Energy and certain other minerals that are not available in the US.

However, the 145 percent tariff is the minimum tariff on Chinese goods, meaning they will be levied on top of any other tariffs that were previously imposed on China. These include Section 301 tariffs placed on Chinese goods during Trump’s first term in office, as well as Biden’s tariffs on Chinese EVs, solar panels, semiconductors, and other various products, ranging from 25 percent to 100 percent. Notably, although Trump’s EO exempts steel and aluminum products from the additional reciprocal tariffs, this will in effect not apply to China as the Biden adminstration already imposed a 25 percent on these products in 2024.

The reciprocal tariffs were first announced on February 13, 2025, when Trump signed a memorandum directing key ministers to implement a plan to impose reciprocal tariffs on all trade partners. The “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” calls for examining non-reciprocal trade relationships with all global partners, including:

- Tariffs on US products;
- Unfair, discriminatory, or extraterritorial taxes on US businesses, workers, and consumers (including VAT);
- Nontariff barriers or measures, including subsidies and regulatory requirements; and
- Policies and practices that cause exchange rates to deviate from their market value.

According to WTO data, in 2023 (the latest available data), China’s simple average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 7.5 percent, with a trade-weighted average of 3 percent. In comparison, the US maintained a lower MFN applied rate of 3.3 percent and a trade-weighted average of 2.2 percent. Breaking it down further, China’s MFN applied tariff rate in 2023 averaged 14 percent for agricultural products and 6.4 percent for non-agricultural products, while the US imposed lower rates of 5 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.

China has also imposed various unilateral tariffs on US goods over the years in addition to the ones levied in the last few months. On April 2, 2018, China implemented tariffs ranging from 15 to 25 percent on 128 US products worth US$3 billion, including fruit, wine, seamless steel pipes, pork, and recycled aluminum in retaliation to the US’s steel and aluminum tariffs. Two days later, it again hit the US with 25 percent tariffs on US$50 billion worth of US goods, including automobiles, aircraft, beef, soybeans, whisky, and chemicals, in retaliation to the US’s imposition of tariffs on 1,333 types of Chinese products, also worth US$50 billion.

China has since granted exemptions for a variety of US goods, including agricultural products such as soybeans and pork, liquefied natural gas, crude oil, steel rails, certain medical equipment, and rare earth products, among others.

## China’s countermeasures

Two days after Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs on China and the rest of the world, China retaliated with a 34 percent tariff on US imports. The announcement from the State Council Tariff Commission clarified that, while the 34 percent rate will apply in addition to other tariffs that are already levied, any current bonded and tax reduction and exemption policies will remain in place. On April 9, following the imposition of the 104 percent tariff, the Ministry of Finance announced that the rate would rise to 84 percent, matching the reciprocal tariff rate Trump had announced a day earlier. This was further raised to 125 percent on April 11, matching Trump’s latest tariff hike on Chinese goods. The State Council Tariff Commission also stated that, given US exports to China are no longer viable under the current duty rates, China will no longer respond to further tariff hikes by the US side.

The new tariff will take effect on April 12, 2025. In addition to the tariff hike, China has also taken several other non-tariff countermeasures. On April 2, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) and Customs Administrations placed export restrictions on seven different types of rare earths, namely various derivations of samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium. A MOFCOM spokesperson stated that these items have “dual-use attributes” and that the export controls are aimed at “better safeguarding national security and interests and fulfilling international obligations such as non-proliferation”.

On April 4, MOFCOM also placed 16 American companies on the “export control list” and 11 American companies on the “unreliable entities list”. On April 9, it added another 12 to the export control list and six to the unreliable entities list.

The stated motive for this move is “to safeguard national security and interests and fulfill international obligations such as non-proliferation”. According to a statement from the MOFCOM spokesperson, the companies added to the unreliable entities list have “carried out so-called military and technical cooperation with Taiwan despite China’s strong opposition, seriously undermining China’s national sovereignty, security and development interests”. Companies included on the export control list will be barred from purchasing certain goods and products from China, while the companies included on the unreliable entities list are prohibited from engaging in import and export activities related to China and may not make any new investments in China.

China has already retaliated to the two prior tariff hikes with import duties in kind. In response to the initial 10 percent tariff hike, China’s Customs Tariff Commission announced a 15 percent tariff on American coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10 percent tariff on American crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement cars, and pickup trucks. On the same day, China’s Ministry of Commerce and Customs Administration announced export controls on 25 rare earth metal items, including various derivations of tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, critical materials for industries such as electronics, aerospace, and renewable energy.

### Impact on China trade

The imposition of a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods is likely to have a significant impact on Chinese exporters, particularly small manufacturers of consumer goods that rely heavily on the US market. Many of these businesses, which produce lower-cost items such as electronics, clothing, toys, and other consumer goods, are vulnerable to the additional costs that the new tariffs impose. These companies may struggle to absorb the additional costs without compromising their competitiveness or profit margins. As a result, many will likely need to explore alternative consumer markets to maintain sales, but this could prove challenging given the highly competitive nature of global markets and the logistical challenges of shifting production and distribution networks.

The US remains an important export market for China. In 2024, China exported US$524.66 billion in goods to the US, accounting for nearly 15 percent of its total exports, according to Customs data. The tariff increase also threatens to spark inflationary pressures, both in the US and globally. Higher tariffs on Chinese goods will likely raise prices for US consumers, leading to a potential decrease in demand. As costs for American consumers rise, purchasing power will shrink, contributing to lower demand for goods not only from China but from other trading partners as well. In turn, this could slow global economic growth as consumer spending contracts.

Despite these challenges, Chinese exporters have the potential to shift their focus to other growing markets, such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These regions are seeing increasing demand for Chinese products, and while they may not yet match the scale or purchasing power of the US market, they present new avenues for growth. Chinese manufacturers may find opportunities to diversify their customer base, thus mitigating some of the negative impacts of US tariffs. Meanwhile, the countertariffs placed on US goods by China will impede the US’s ability to sell more goods to China, thereby directly countering the desired impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs – to balance bilateral trade. However, the move is likely intended to give China better leverage in any potential trade negotiations, and to send a message to the US that it will not be bullied, rather than a desire to curb American imports.

The fallout from Trump’s tariffs on countries like Canada, Mexico, and those in the European Union could present an unexpected opportunity for China. As these countries face their own challenges in navigating Trump’s trade policies, they may look to strengthen trade relations with China. This could lead to a closer alignment between China and some of its smaller trade partners, as the restructuring of global trade may make it more advantageous for these nations to partner with China in certain areas, such as technology, manufacturing, and raw materials.

## End to de minimis exemption and imposition of 90 percent tariff on Chinese parcels

On April 2, the same day the US raised the tariff on China to 54 percent, Trump signed an EO to once again end the de minimis exemption for parcels originating from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. The de minimis exemption allows low-value packages – those worth under US$800 – to enter the US without customs duties or inspections. According to analysts, roughly four million packages per day entered the US under this exemption in 2024, many of them from Chinese e-commerce companies. Trump had previously attempted to revoke the exemption as part of his February 1 tariff package but reversed the move within a week.

The April 2 EO claims that “adequate systems” are now in place to assess and collect duties on incoming parcels. As a result, the US will begin imposing duties on small-value packages from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong starting May 2, 2025.

The Trump administration has justified the move by alleging that Chinese-based shippers use the de minimis channel to engage in deceptive shipping practices. The EO states that some Chinese exporters “hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents” of parcels, avoiding detection due to the limited screening associated with de minimis treatment. The White House has linked this to broader concerns about fentanyl trafficking, which it claims is facilitated in part through these small parcels.

The April 2 EO implemented a 30 percent ad valorem duty on the declared value of the parcel, or a per-item duty of US$25, starting May 1. The per-item duty was to rise to US$50 beginning June 1. However, in the same EO that was signed on April 8 to raise the reciprocal tariff rate to 84 percent, the Trump administration also tripled the de minimis duties on these small parcels, and then hiked the rates again a day later through another EO. Under the latest rules, packages from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong will be subject to the following duties:

- An ad valorem duty of 120 percent of the declared value of the postal item; or
- A specific duty of:
  - US$100 per item between May 2 and May 31, 2025
  - US$200 per item beginning June 1, 2025

The April 2 EO also directs the Secretary of Commerce to make an assessment of the potential impact of the order on American consumers and businesses, and provide a recommendation on whether the end of the exemption should also be extended to Macau “to prevent circumvention of this order”.

### Impact on China trade

The end of the de minimis exemption is expected to significantly disrupt the US e-commerce landscape, with ripple effects for consumers, global logistics networks, and the broader trade environment. Online platforms such as Shein, Temu, and Amazon, along with thousands of small and mid-sized US businesses that rely on low-cost Chinese imports, are particularly vulnerable. Speaking to the Securities Times, Wang Xiaoyan, Deputy Director of the Henan International Digital Trade Research Institute, said that the end of the de minimis exemption represents a “precise blow” to China’s cross-border e-commerce model, and that the move “weakens the cost-effectiveness” advantage of Chinese exports.

Wang also noted that the US policy shift could act as a precedent for other governments, potentially triggering a wave of tighter regulations elsewhere. The EU, Thailand, Vietnam, and Singapore are reportedly considering similar policy adjustments, suggesting broader global scrutiny of low-value imports and efforts to curb China’s export-driven digital commerce model. However, in the US, large platforms like Shein and Temu may be able to absorb some of the impact by adapting their operations. Speaking to the _New York Times_, Sheng Lu, an apparel business professor at the University of Delaware, explained that Shein’s model of rapid, small-batch production in China is not easily replicated elsewhere, and that “There’s no realistic alternative to make their products”.

Meanwhile, according to the _New York Times_ report, both Shein and Temu have already been diversifying by partnering with US vendors and establishing warehouses in the US, which could mitigate some disruptions. Aaron Rubin, CEO of ShipHero, a warehouse management software company, emphasized that the EO will not destroy companies like Shein or Temu, rather, it will “change the business model”. The end of the de minimis exemption is nonetheless expected to have a significant impact on smaller American businesses who rely on these cheap imports from China, and will find it difficult to pass on the costs to their price-sensitive consumers. Additionally, it is also expected to affect millions of US consumers, who will experience delivery delays, higher prices, or both.

## 25 percent steel and aluminum tariffs

On February 10, Trump signed proclamations restoring the 25 percent tariff on all steel imports (the “steel proclamation”) and raising the tariff on aluminum imports from 10 to 25 percent (the “aluminum proclamation”). The tariffs, which apply to imports from all countries and regions, took effect on March 12, 2025. Trump first imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum in 2018 following the release of the Section 232 Investigation, which found that steel and aluminum products were arriving in the US “in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security” of the country.

In 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports after a Section 232 Investigation found that these imports threatened US national security. According to the steel proclamation, the 25 percent steel tariff initially reduced reliance on imports and boosted domestic consumption. However, due to exemptions and agreements made during both the Trump and Biden administrations, imported steel now makes up a similar portion of US consumption as before the tariffs.

Meanwhile, the aluminum declaration states that the 10 percent aluminum tariff was less effective, as efforts to bypass the tariff and various country exemptions led to a decline in domestic aluminum smelter capacity utilization, preventing the tariff from achieving its intended national security goals. Both proclamations highlight a global excess capacity crisis for steel and aluminum, with rising Chinese steel exports displacing production in other countries and leading to increased steel imports to the US. The Biden administration had already raised the tariff on imports of Chinese steel and aluminum products to 25 percent in September 2024. This means that China’s steel and aluminum were already subject to a 25 percent tariff when entering the US before Trump imposed his new tariff regime. Moreover, the 10 percent tariff on aluminum coming from China has remained in place since 2018.

### Impact on China trade

China currently exports relatively small amounts of steel and aluminum directly to the US, accounting for just 0.8 percent of China’s total steel exports in 2024. However, the global nature of Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs means that Chinese steel exports to other countries may be impacted. Major sources for US steel imports, such as Vietnam and Canada, accounted for 25.22 percent of China’s total steel exports in 2024, according to Investor.org.cn. As the tariffs are effective worldwide, they will indirectly affect Chinese steel re-exports to the US via these third countries, thereby significantly impacting China’s global steel exports and restructuring global industry chains.

Similarly, China’s aluminum exports to the US have already been declining for four consecutive years, making up just 8.2 percent of China’s total aluminum exports in 2024, according to Wuchan Zhongda Futures Research Institute. This decline is largely due to previous high US anti-dumping duties. As a result, the direct impact of Trump’s new aluminum tariffs on China’s exports is expected to be limited. However, a greater effect may come from potential disruptions in re-export trade through Mexico and Canada, where a significant share of Chinese aluminum exports currently flow. China’s annual aluminum exports are about 5 to 6 million tons, accounting for 12.85 percent of production.

In 2023, Mexico was China’s largest export destination for aluminum, accounting for 9.6 percent of total aluminum exports, while the US and Canada accounted for 4.6 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively. Aluminum exported to the North American Free Trade Zone accounted for 18 percent of China’s total aluminum exports. According to Li Kui, a non-ferrous metals researcher at Huarong Rongda Futures, while the short-term impact of Trump’s tariff hike may be limited, in the medium to long term, it could negatively affect China’s aluminum export trade. China has historically faced anti-dumping duties ranging from 10 percent to 75 percent across various countries, leading to a 30 percent to 60 percent decline in exports. Trump’s new tariffs will raise the duties on some Chinese aluminum products from 7.5 percent to 25 percent, which could further deter direct shipments to the US while closing off indirect export routes through Mexico and Canada.

## 25 percent tariff on global auto imports

On March 26, Trump signed a proclamation imposing a 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles and certain auto parts, citing a “critical threat to US national security.” The tariffs officially took effect on April 3. Revitalizing the once-thriving US automobile industry has been a key pillar of Trump’s economic agenda, closely tied to his promise to bring back manufacturing jobs. The proclamation highlights that in 1985, US factories produced 97 percent of the vehicles sold domestically. By contrast, in 2024, 50 percent of the 16 million vehicles purchased by Americans were imported, with only 25 percent of their content manufactured in the US.

### Impact on China Trade

Although China is a leading global car producer and exporter, the US is not a primary market for Chinese vehicles. As a result, China is not the main target of this tariff, which is instead aimed at major US trading partners such as Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and Germany. According to the ITC Trade Map, China exported US$20.4 billion worth of vehicles and auto parts to the US in 2024, accounting for just 5.2 percent of total US auto imports by value. China’s top vehicle export destinations in 2024 included Russia, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, and Brazil. Meanwhile, Western Europe and Southeast Asia were the largest markets for Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), with the UK and Belgium leading in Europe and Thailand leading in Asia.

## US-China dialogue and possible trade negotiations

Trump’s escalation of tariffs on China and his generally confrontational stance toward global trade make a potential trade deal between the US and China in the near future seem unlikely. However, both sides have expressed the need to come to the negotiating table to resolve their ongoing trade tensions. According to the White House fact sheet, the new tariffs will remain in place until Trump “determines that the threat posed by the trade deficit and underlying nonreciprocal treatment is satisfied, resolved, or mitigated.” This suggests that Trump may be willing to halt or defer the tariffs if a deal can be reached, similar to his actions with Mexico and Canada in February. However, given the size of the US’s trade deficit with China, it remains uncertain how much can be done to convince Trump that the “nonreciprocal” treatment has been sufficiently addressed.

A video call held on March 26 between US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng suggested little progress on potential negotiations. Greer emphasized Trump’s commitment to a trade policy that strengthens domestic industry and ensures fair competition, while He conveyed China’s concerns over additional tariffs, particularly those related to fentanyl and the Section 301 investigation. Both sides agreed on the importance of maintaining stable economic relations, but no significant breakthroughs were made.

On March 23, Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with US Senator Steve Daines in Beijing during the annual China Development Forum. Li emphasized the importance of dialogue and cooperation, warning that escalating tensions would harm both countries’ economic and trade interests. This meeting, the first between Chinese and US officials since Trump took office, signals a desire for continued communication and collaboration, even amid growing trade disputes. Trump also stated in early February that he had spoken to Xi Jinping, describing their relationship as very positive; however, the Chinese side has not confirmed these discussions. It is unlikely that substantial progress will be made until there can be a face-to-face meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping. Trump’s personal politics, including his respect for Xi and his susceptibility to flattery, suggest that a meeting could be pivotal in persuading him to reach an agreement.

The possibility of a trade deal between the US and China hinges on several factors. Previous trade agreements, such as the Phase One trade deal reached under Trump’s first term, have shown that both sides are capable of reaching agreements on specific issues, such as intellectual property protections, agricultural exports, and currency manipulation. Trump has suggested he may consider lowering tariffs on China in exchange for a deal involving the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok, which facing an April 5 deadline to be sold or face a potential US ban. Trump extended the deadline by a further 75 days on April 4 amid reports that the reciprocal tariffs imposed on China on April 2 had scuppered a potential deal between the US and ByteDance to seel the US portion of the TikTok business. This could provide a potential leverage point for negotiation and allow China to give Trump a “win”.

However, a more comprehensive deal would require significant concessions on both sides. For a successful trade deal to materialize, China would likely need to address US concerns over nonreciprocal trade practices, such as the alleged forced technology transfers and unfair market access. On the other hand, the US would need to reduce its tariffs in exchange for concrete progress in these areas. Additionally, continued dialogue between the two nations, especially through direct meetings between Trump and Xi, could help break the deadlock and create an environment conducive to further negotiations. The tone of past trade deals suggests that personalized diplomacy and the willingness to reach mutually beneficial agreements will be key to advancing any future US-China trade resolution.
