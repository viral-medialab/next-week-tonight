With nearly 200 million users in the U.S. alone, the video-sharing app TikTok has become a cultural phenomenon—especially among younger generations. But the app's days may be numbered in the U.S.: On January 17, the Supreme Court upheld a ban on TikTok, citing national security concerns. The ban is slated to take effect on January 19.
For its users, the loss of the app might cause more than just boredom. It could also have some negative impacts on their health, experts say. Here’s what to know.
TikTok and Mental Health
Like other forms of social media, TikTok has been linked to mental health issues, especially among young people. A 2022 study published in the journal Child and Adolescent Mental Health found that TikTok use was associated with increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in adolescents.
“For many teens and young adults, social media has become their main form of communication, community, and even self-expression,” says Thea Gallagher, PsyD, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor at NYU Langone Health. “If they’re suddenly cut off from that, it could lead to feelings of isolation, anxiety, or even depression.”
However, Gallagher also points out that TikTok can also be a source of negative mental health effects, such as body image issues, cyberbullying, and exposure to harmful content. “For some people, a TikTok ban could actually be a good thing for their mental health,” she says.
Other Potential Health Effects
In addition to mental health, TikTok has also been linked to other potential health effects, such as:
Sleep problems: A 2021 study published in the Journal of Sleep Research found that TikTok use was associated with decreased sleep quality and increased daytime sleepiness in adolescents.
Eye strain: Staring at a screen for long periods of time can cause eye strain, headaches, and blurred vision.
Repetitive strain injuries: Using your hands and fingers to scroll through TikTok videos for hours on end can lead to repetitive strain injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
What Happens Next?
It's still unclear what will happen to TikTok in the U.S. The ban could be reversed by the incoming Trump administration, or TikTok could be sold to a U.S. company.
In the meantime, experts recommend that TikTok users take steps to protect their health, such as setting limits on their use of the app, taking breaks from screens, and seeking help if they're experiencing any mental health issues.
