TikTok is no longer accessible to users in the United States. The app "went dark" early Sunday morning after the Supreme Court upheld a ban on the video-sharing service.
The ban is the culmination of a long-running battle between the federal government and TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. The government has argued that TikTok poses a national security risk because the Chinese government could access user data or manipulate content on the platform.
TikTok has denied these allegations, but the Supreme Court sided with the government.
Users attempting to access TikTok on Sunday are being redirected to a webpage that details the ban and provides instructions on how to download their personal information.
TikTok has roughly 170 million monthly users in the U.S.
