The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the ban on TikTok, the popular video-sharing app. The ban, which is set to take effect on Sunday, is the culmination of a long-running battle between the federal government and TikTok's parent company, ByteDance.
The government has argued that TikTok poses a national security risk because the Chinese government could access user data or manipulate content on the platform. TikTok has denied these allegations, but the Supreme Court sided with the government.
The ruling allows the federal government to legally shut down TikTok in the U.S. starting Sunday. The ban is the result of a law passed last year that requires TikTok to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a ban in the U.S.
TikTok has argued that the law violates Americans' First Amendment free speech rights, but the Supreme Court rejected that argument.
