What to know about TikTok’s looming US ban
The US Supreme Court has upheld a law passed by Congress that forces TikTok to cease operations in the country unless it is sold to a new owner.

Hours before a ban that would shut off TikTok to some 170 million monthly users in the United States was set to take effect, the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a law passed by Congress that forces the company to cease operations in the country unless it is sold to a new owner.
The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was passed in April 2024 and gave TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, 270 days to find a buyer.
On December 6, TikTok asked a US federal court to block the law, arguing that it violates Americans’ First Amendment free speech rights. That request was ultimately denied, and on January 17, the Supreme Court declined to take up the case.
TikTok is expected to “go dark” when the ban officially takes effect on Sunday, January 19.
What happens to TikTok users?
Anyone in the US who tries to access TikTok after the ban takes effect will be redirected to a webpage explaining the ban and offering instructions on how to download any personal information they want to keep.
TikTok has roughly 170 million monthly users in the US, many of whom have grown accustomed to spending hours on the app each day.
The ban may especially upset small business owners, who often rely on TikTok to advertise their services to a large audience.
Why is TikTok being banned?
US lawmakers have expressed concerns that TikTok’s Chinese ownership makes the app vulnerable to the Chinese government, which could use it to harvest data on US citizens or push pro-Beijing propaganda.
In March 2023, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before Congress, where he attempted to assuage lawmakers’ fears about the app’s ties to the Chinese government.
“ByteDance is not an agent of China,” Chew said at the time. “It is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government, and it is a private, global company.”
What are the possible solutions?
One possible resolution could be reviving the “Project Texas” national security arrangement, which would designate the Texas-based software company Oracle as a supervisor over data transactions in the US.
Lawmakers have also suggested that TikTok could resolve the issue by cutting ties with ByteDance.
“Divestiture is obviously the key to addressing the lawmakers’ concerns,” US Representative Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, told CBS News in March 2023.
What are the wider implications?
The TikTok situation could set a precedent for future US actions against other applications owned by Chinese entities or other foreign adversaries.
“This is one of the most significant cases of internet regulation that we’ve seen in a long time,” Matt Perault, a professor at the University of North Carolina, told the Associated Press news agency.
“It could signal a new approach in the US to regulating internet applications owned by foreign entities and other foreign adversaries,” Perault added.
The ban has been praised by some and criticised by others.
Human rights organisation Amnesty International has argued that the ban will not solve the broader issues related to Big Tech harms.
“The US ban on TikTok is a blunt instrument that fails to address the real concerns around manipulation, privacy violations, and online harms,” Amnesty International said in a statement on Friday.
“This decision will do nothing to alleviate the broader problems with Big Tech, which requires comprehensive regulation.”
Meanwhile, social media consultants are advising TikTok users to back up their content and consider moving to established platforms like Facebook and Instagram.
