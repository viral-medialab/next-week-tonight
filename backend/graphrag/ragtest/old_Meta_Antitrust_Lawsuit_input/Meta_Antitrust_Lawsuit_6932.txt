The plain text from the requested URL appears to be a Meta (formerly Facebook) press release titled "The FTC's Weak Case Against Meta Ignores Reality" dated April 13, 2025. According to the search results, the article discusses Meta's position on the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC that attempts to undo Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp[2].

The trial began on April 14, 2025, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifying on the first day of the proceedings[3]. The FTC's lawsuit alleges that Meta has accumulated monopoly power through anti-competitive mergers, particularly focusing on the acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014[3][4].

Meta appears to be defending itself against these allegations, with the article likely presenting the company's arguments that the FTC's case is weak and doesn't reflect market realities[2]. If the case brought by the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to sell Instagram and WhatsApp[4].

The full plain text content of the article isn't available in the search results, but the title and date indicate it was published just before the trial began as part of Meta's public defense strategy against the FTC's antitrust lawsuit.
