# Meta Defeats Photo App’s Antitrust Case in US Court

A U.S. judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought against Meta Platforms Inc. (formerly Facebook) by Phhhoto Inc., a photo software startup. Phhhoto’s 2021 lawsuit alleged that Meta’s social media business intentionally undermined Phhhoto as an “innovative nascent competitor,” degrading the quality of its content and app performance and misleading consumers by leveraging Meta’s control over critical infrastructure.

U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, sitting in Brooklyn, New York, dismissed the suit on the grounds that Phhhoto failed to file its claims within the relevant statute of limitations. Although Phhhoto submitted an extensive complaint, the judge found it lacked sufficient facts to address the lateness of its federal claims. The court also denied Phhhoto’s request to amend and refile its complaint.

A Meta spokesperson called the lawsuit “meritless,” and Facebook denied any anticompetitive conduct.

The dismissal is considered a legal win for Meta, though it was based on procedural grounds. The broader debate over competition in the tech sector continues, with increasing regulatory scrutiny on large companies such as Meta[1].
