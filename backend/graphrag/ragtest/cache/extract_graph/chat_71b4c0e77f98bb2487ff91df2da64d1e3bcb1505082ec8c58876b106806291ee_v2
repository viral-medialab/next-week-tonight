Rather than force TikTok to take the app dark, the ban targets third-party companies like cloud-service providers and app stores, meaning TikTok could circumvent such restrictions, at least temporarily.\nThe platform became unavailable for some users Saturday evening, with a popup message in the app saying, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\" By Sunday morning, App stores run by Apple, Google and Samsung began removing the app.\nThe Biden administration said earlier this week that it would not enforce the ban on Sunday, leaving implementation of the measure to President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. Trump has vowed to reverse the ban.... Here's what could be next for TikTok.\nTikTok's quality is expected to worsen\nTikTok could remain available for U.S. users over the coming days and weeks but the app would likely degrade in quality, experts previously told ABC News.\nThe reason is because the ban would place restrictions on app stores and hosting companies, which provide the digital infrastructure on which web services like TikTok depend.\nMandatory withdrawal of the app from major app stores would not only bar new users from downloading the app, it also would prevent existing users from updating it.\nApple in a support update posted on Sunday said users who already installed ByteDance apps will be able to keep them on their device.\n\"But they can't be redownloaded if deleted or restored if you move to a new device,\" Apple said. \"In-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible.\"\nWithout updates, the app would worsen in quality over time, some experts said – for example, through inconveniences such as video-loading delays and performance glitches.\nA separate stipulation in the ban would also make it illegal for hosting companies to provide services for TikTok. The measure offers a fairly broad characterization of such firms.\nTikTok would stop functioning if the firm's U.S.-based hosting companies stopped providing services. However, the social media giant could establish partnerships with hosting companies outside the U.S., putting them out of reach of U.S. enforcement – in theory, at least.... Such a move would keep TikTok available to U.S. users, but the service would likely be slower and glitchier as the digital infrastructure moves farther away, experts said.\nTrump has vowed to reverse the ban\nTrump is considering what executive actions he has available to allow TikTok to keep operating, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.\nOne option is an executive order that could attempt to direct the government to not enforce the law, but that avenue faces legal roadblocks, experts told ABC News, chief of which is that an executive order can't override a law that Congress has passed and that has now been upheld by the Supreme Court.\nTrump's Justice Department could still opt against enforcement of the law, reassuring app stores and cloud-service providers that they wouldn't face prosecution in the event of a violation.\nWhile the Justice Department has enforcement discretion, app providers like Apple and Google could still be subject to hefty fines under a law that has a five-year statute of limitations, which would extend it beyond the length of Trump's presidential term.\nPam Bondi, Trump's nominee for attorney general, declined to say during her confirmation hearing this week whether she would commit to enforcing the TikTok ban.\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who will attend Trump's inauguration after receiving an invitation from the incoming administration, thanked Trump in a video posted to TikTok on Friday after the Supreme Court ruling.... \"I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,\" Chew said.\nCongress may take up the ban a second time\nTikTok may await a potential repeal of the law that banned the app in the first place.\nA repeal would require passage in both houses of Congress, landing the measure on Trump's desk for his signature.\nCongress voted in favor of the ban only nine months ago. In the House of Representatives, the ban passed by an overwhelming margin of 352-65. In the Senate, 79 members voted in favor of the measure, while 18 opposed and three abstained.\nSince then, however, Trump has voiced his disapproval of the measure and Republicans have taken control of both chambers of Congress. Even so, whether such a repeal would make its way to the floor, and its fate should it do so, are impossible to forecast.\n\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-bans-tiktok/story?id=117743883\n\n---\nAnswer from Perplexity: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-want-to-get-all-the-news-cov-8QSU6uRKThGDnNlG5VM4EA?utm_source=copy_output\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
