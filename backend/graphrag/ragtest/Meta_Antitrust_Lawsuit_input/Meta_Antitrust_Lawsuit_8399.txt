The antitrust trial brought against Meta by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reportedly focused on what the company's platforms do and who they compete with.

These determinations are important because the antitrust case depends on proving that Meta's products have a monopoly in what the FTC calls "personal social networking services."

Meta aims to counter this claim by arguing that it competes in a variety of areas and against a wide range of rivals.

At stake is the FTC's effort to break up Meta, with the company's Instagram and WhatsApp platforms being spun off.

This has been the focus of the trial over the past week.

So far in the trial, the FTC has focused on differences between Meta's products and other companies' platforms, saying that:
- Some platforms allow users to sign up anonymously and used pseudonyms, while Meta's Facebook has rules against that
- Some platforms show content that matches a user's interests, while Facebook and Instagram have historically centered on users' friends and family
- Other platforms' marketing materials have focused on the differences between them and Meta's platforms

Meta has argued during the trial that:
- Its products have evolved
- The percentage of posts seen by users that are tied to friends and family has been declining for years
- Other social media platforms offer features that enable users to connect with friends
