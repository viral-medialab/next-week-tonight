**Historical Background and Origins (2020–2022)**

- On December 8, 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), joined by 46 US states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook (now Meta Platforms). The suit alleged Meta maintained monopoly power by acquiring rivals Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014), and by imposing anticompetitive conditions on software developers[1][3].
- The case was initially dismissed in June 2021 but was later allowed to proceed after the FTC amended its filing in August 2021[1][3].
- The complaint sought to force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp in order to restore competition in the social media and messaging markets[1][3].

**Key Issues and Developments**

- The lawsuit focuses on whether Meta’s acquisitions and business conduct unlawfully stifled competition, harming both consumers and innovation[1][2][3].
- Meta has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, arguing its acquisitions benefitted users and that the market remains dynamic with emerging competitors[2][5].
- The company attempted several legal maneuvers to dismiss or delay the case, all of which were denied in federal court across 2022 and 2024[1][2].

**The 2025 Trial**
