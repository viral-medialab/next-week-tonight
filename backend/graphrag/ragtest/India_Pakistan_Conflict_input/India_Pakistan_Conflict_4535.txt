# 2025 India–Pakistan conflict

The 2025 India–Pakistan conflict was a brief armed conflict between India and Pakistan that began on 7 May 2025, after India launched missile strikes on Pakistan, codenamed Operation Sindoor. India stated that the operation was a response to the Pahalgam attack on 22 April by militants in the Indian administered Kashmir killing 26 civilians, mostly tourists. The attack intensified tensions between India and Pakistan as India accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, which Pakistan denied.
According to India, the missile strikes of Operation Sindoor targeted the camps and infrastructure of militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, and no Pakistani military facilities were targeted. According to Pakistan, the Indian strikes targeted civilian areas, including mosques, killing 31 Pakistani civilians. Following these strikes, border skirmishes and drone strikes occurred between the two countries. On 10 May, Pakistan launched an operation codenamed Operation Bunyan al-Marsus in retaliation, targeting several Indian military bases. In retaliation, India also continued Operation Sindoor, expanding its scope to target Pakistani military installations. This conflict marked the first drone battle between the two nuclear-armed nations.
After three days of the conflict, both India and Pakistan announced that a ceasefire was agreed, effective from 5:00 pm IST/04:30 pm PKT (11:30 UTC) on 10 May, with talks set for 12 May. Following the deadline, both countries accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement.

## Background

The Kashmir conflict, ongoing since 1947, has fuelled multiple wars and skirmishes between India and Pakistan over the disputed region. On 22 April 2025, a terrorist attack by militants near Pahalgam in the Indian administered Kashmir killed 28 civilians, mostly Hindu tourists. The attack was claimed by The Resistance Front, an offshoot of the militant organization Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is backed by Pakistan, though the group later denied responsibility and said it had been hacked. In the aftermath, India and Pakistan announced a series of actions targeting the other and engaged in military conflicts.

## Timeline

### 7 May

On 7 May 2025, the Indian Armed Forces launched a series of 14 attacks, codenamed Operation Sindoor, targeting nine locations in Pakistani-administered Kashmir and Pakistan's Punjab province. The attack was presumably carried out by the Rafale aircraft of the Indian Air Force using SCALP missiles and AASM Hammer glide bombs over a 23-minute duration. Reportedly, BrahMos cruise missiles as well as Indian Army's Indo-Israeli SkyStriker loitering munitions were also used in the operation. A Pakistani general said that the strikes were conducted without Indian aircraft entering Pakistani airspace. 
The Indian government described the strikes as "focused, measured, and non-escalatory". It claimed that the missile strikes targeted the infrastructure of terrorist groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba; and no Pakistani military facilities were targeted. The missile strikes targeted camps across nine locations including Bahawalpur and Muridke, alleged to be the hubs of terrorist organizations Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba respectively. 
According to India, Pakistani cross-border artillery shelling and small arms firing increased following the Indian attacks, including in the regions of Kupwara, Baramulla, Uri and Akhnoor, located in Indian-administered Kashmir.
Pakistan claimed to have shot down three Rafales, one MiG-29, one SU-30MKI and an unmanned aerial vehicle. A French intelligence official told CNN that an Indian Rafale was downed by Pakistan, though the French military did not comment. Reuters reported that unnamed Indian government sources said that three fighter jets had crashed in India due to unknown causes. On 8 May, an unnamed US official told Reuters that he assessed with "high confidence" that Pakistani J-10 aircraft had shot down at least two Indian fighter jets; a second official assessed one of the downed jets to be a Dassault Rafale. The Indian government has not confirmed if any of its planes have been shot down. The Washington Post later claimed to have identified 3 crash sites in India from 7 May, identifying two of them as belonging to an Indian Dassault Rafale and Dassault Mirage 2000. On 9 May, local government sources in Indian Kashmir told Reuters 3 fighter jets crashed in India on 7 May with 3 pilots being hospitalized.
American geopolitical analyst Brandon J. Weichert described the aerial duel between both countries as an unambiguous victory for Pakistan, insofar as western observers had not expected Chinese-made equipment to be able to shoot down the Rafales.

### 8 May

In response, Indian authorities claimed that Pakistan launched drone and missile strikes across several Indian cities, including Amritsar, and that India negated these strikes by the S-400 missile system. This was India's first combat use of the S-400 missile system, known locally as Sudarshan Chakra. The Indian government said it was "compelled to respond to bring Mortar and Artillery fire from Pakistan to a halt". However, Pakistan denied these claims and asserted that the Indian Army mistakenly struck itself in Amritsar and blamed it on Pakistan to fuel anti-Pakistan sentiment among Sikhs.
In response, Indian Armed Forces carried out SEAD/DEAD operations and claimed to have neutralized the air defence systems in Lahore. Pakistani authorities said that several Indian drones intruded in Pakistani airspace, and 12 Indian drones were shot down. As per Pakistan, these drones were sent into nine different locations including the cities of Karachi and Lahore, and one of the drones struck a Pakistani military facility near Lahore. The Pakistani military later claimed to have shot down 25 Israeli-made Harop loitering munitions in the Pakistani side of the border, an Indian government source confirmed at least one of those being taken down. A drone also landed inside the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium complex before the start of a Pakistan Super League Twenty20 match, prompting the Pakistan Cricket Board to transfer the games to the United Arab Emirates.
India's defence minister stated at an all-party meet that Operation Sindoor was still underway.
Pakistan launched an airstrike directed in and around Jammu district including the airport and the Jammu University at in the evening. All of the eight adversary missiles were claimed to have been intercepted by the S-400 missile system. Reportedly, multiple explosions were heard in Jammu along with an explosion in Jaisalmer, where drones and fighter jets were also reported. According to the press brief by Foreign Secretary Misri on 9 May, these attacks involved 300-400 Turkish-Asisguard Songar drones targeting 36 sites, including civilian and military infrastructure. In response, India also launched armed drones against four air defence sites in Pakistan and, reportedly, one of the drones had destroyed a Pakistani AD radar successfully. India also reported cross border firing by heavy calibre artillery guns along the Line of Control (LoC).
Pakistani general Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry made a statement in Islamabad denying India's claim of Pakistani forces attacking 15 locations in India, stating that they made a "fantastic and well-cooked story" to generate "hype" and that "every projectile leaves a digital trace and signature". 
Reports termed this conflict as the "first drone war" between the "nuclear-armed neighbours" of South Asia; the deployment of Israeli-Indian drones was particularly noteworthy.

### 9 May

Pakistani media reported that India attacked Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib, which was denied by Indian authorities. Foreign Secretary of India, Vikram Misri addressed the allegations in the media briefing of 9 May. He referred to such claims as a blatant lie and a part of Pakistan's campaign to impart communal discord. The Pakistan Army also claimed to have neutralised 77 Indian drones since 6 May.
Exchanges of fire had stopped in the early morning. However, clashes restarted after "13 hours of relative calm". Exchanges of artillery fire began in Kupwara, Poonch, Uri, and Samba along the LoC. Pakistan reportedly targeted 26 locations across LoC and International Border from the Baramulla in the North to Bhuj in the South with drones including armed ones. One of the drones which targeted a civilian region in Firozpur led to severe injuries to a family.
In 9 May, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the director-general of Pakistan Inter-Services Public Relations, accompanied by senior officials from the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy, held a press briefing in Islamabad. The officials categorically denied Indian allegations that Pakistan had conducted missile and drone strikes on Indian military installations. They challenged India to present verifiable evidence and criticized Indian media for allegedly spreading misinformation after the Pahalgam incident. They stated that their military response was limited to Indian posts that had targeted civilian areas and denied involvement in the Pahalgam attack, questioning how Indian authorities registered an FIR and identified suspects within ten minutes. Pakistan proposed a neutral third-party investigation, which it claimed was ignored by India.
He also claimed that India had launched six ballistic missiles from Adampur, with five landing near Amritsar and one striking Adampur itself. According to Chaudhry, these missiles targeted Sikh populations in an alleged false flag operation aimed at generating domestic support. In a press briefing, Foreign Secretary of India, Vikram Misri addressed the Amritsar claims of Pakistan. He called these claims as nothing but Pakistan's desperate attempts to disown it's own acts of agression. He said that these claims are made to mislead and decieve the world. He further added that Pakistan's attack on a Gurdwara in Poonch led to the death of Gurdwara's Ragi among other locals of Sikh community. 
Pakistan rejected Indian assertions of having struck 15 Pakistani targets. In the same briefing, Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed presented evidence of downing five Indian fighter jets, including Rafale aircraft, supported by audio recordings and flight data.

Heavy shelling and fire were reported near the city of Rajouri in Indian-administered Kashmir, the Chief minister of India-administered Kashmir, Omar Abdullah later reported in X that the commissioner of the city, Raj Kumar Thapa, was killed by Pakistani shelling on his house. Later, Indian local media claimed that five people were killed in the same shelling. India's military said that Pakistan's retaliatory strikes targeted civilian areas, including a Hindu temple in Jammu. The Defence Ministry added that multiple armed drones were used overnight, putting both civilians and religious sites at risk. Analyst Michael Kugelman posited that the two countries were now "effectively at war"; but neither side had mobilized ground forces, according to a former Indian diplomat.
During a press briefing by India's MEA and MoD, officials confirmed that Pakistan has mobilised its troops into forward areas, escalating the seriousness of the situation. India also published timestamped images confirming that IAF airbases including Sirsa Air Force Station and Suratgarh Air Force Station were not damaged which was otherwise claimed by other reports. India also denied claims of the destruction of S-400 and BrahMos missile systems. Vyomika Singh claimed Pakistan attempted strikes on military and civilian infrastructure with the use of drones, long-range weapons, loitering munitions and fighter jets at more than 26 places. Pakistan also "used high-speed missiles at 1:40 am to target Punjab's air base". Air force bases in Udhampur, Bhuj, and Pathankot suffered minor damage. 
The Indian Army released images of what it said were debris of a Baykar YIHA III loitering munition destroyed by the air defence units. It claimed the drones were used to target civilians areas in Khasa Cantt, Amritsar at around 5 am. India claimed it carried out precision airstrikes on Pakistan Air Force bases at Rafiqui, Murid, Chaklala, and Rahim Yar Khan in retaliation for drone attacks along the western sector.

It reported that Markaz Taiba Mosque of Muridke being used as a terrorist complex. Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) told Sky news that, it has been long known for decades about the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke. It was denied by Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif who called it a media hoax. Similarly, Al-Jazeera noted this site as the most significant among the others hit by India. This compound was founded by NIA Most Wanted, Lashkar-e-Taiba's co-founder Hafiz Saeed. Saeed also founded Jamaat-ud-Dawa as a rebrand of Lashkar-e-Taiba. They pose as a charity group according to MEMRI.

According to Pakistan, three Dassault Rafales, one MiG-29 and one Su-30MKI fighter jet belonging to the Indian Air Force were reportedly shot down. If true, this event would marked the first time that a French-origin Dassault Rafale, has been lost in combat, having been shot down by the Chinese-origin Chengdu J-10. This, along with the performance of Chinese-origin PL-15 missiles in the combat, reportedly gained global attention. According to the French newspaper Le Monde, this military operation against Pakistan revealed weaknesses in the Indian Air Force.
According to Pakistan, the Pakistan Air Force intercepted and destroyed 77 Israeli-made Harop drones, sent by India to target terrorist installations.

According to the BBC, there were a number of misinformation campaigns in both countries following the strikes.
The Indian Premier League transferred a match between Punjab Kings and the Mumbai Indians scheduled at Dharamsala on 11 May to Ahmedabad, citing the closure of Kangra Airport and other logistical issues caused by the ongoing tensions. On 9 May, the tournament was suspended for a week. Similarly, during Pakistan Super League, a match between Karachi Kings and Peshawar Zalmi was postponed. On 9 May, the Pakistan Super League was reportedly suspended "indefinitely" because of "worsening of the situation between India and Pakistan".

This measure received protests from Bangladeshi government.

## Ceasefire

### Agreement

On 10 May 2025, the Foreign Secretary of India Vikram Misri and the Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar stated that both militaries agreed to a full ceasefire and that hostilities would end as of 5:00 p.m. IST/4:30 pm PKT (11:30 GMT).
Dar stated that 36 countries helped broker the truce. An Indian official told Agence France Presse that the ceasefire was negotiated bilaterally in the sense that "stoppage of firing and military action between India and Paksitan was worked out directly between the two countries". United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared that both nations would discuss "a broad set of issues at a neutral site" and that he and Vice President JD Vance had extensively corresponded with senior officials on both sides. Hours later, following ceasefire violations, Indian officials had not yet voiced readiness for talks. US president Donald Trump made a post on social media about the ceasefire around late noon IST/PKT, prior to the official announcements by the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers. Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif stated that Trump had played a "pivotal and paramount role" in facilitating the truce along with representatives of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, the UK, UN, and China. Thanking the heads of India and Pakistan, President Trump vowed to enhance trade "substantially" with both nations.
Following the agreement, Pakistan reopened its airspace to commercial flights. Military hotlines between the two states were activated.

### Accusations of violations

Minutes after the ceasefire announcement, loud explosions were heard and projectiles were seen in the sky over the cities of Srinagar and Jammu in Indian-administered Kashmir. Late on 10 May, Misri stated that there had been violations of the ceasefire agreement, citing cross-border firing and sightings of Pakistani drones over Srinagar and Punjab, and called on Pakistani authorities to "address [the] violations". Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah also reported explosions in Srinagar, expressing concern over the apparent collapse of the ceasefire. Pakistani Information Minister Atta Tarar denied Indian claims that Pakistan had violated the ceasefire, calling reports by the Indian media as "baseless". Pakistan later also accused India of committing ceasefire violations in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. By 11 May, reports suggested that "serious violations" of the truce had ceased, and that the situation had stabilized in many cities on the Indian side of the LoC. Businesses reopened in Srinagar as calm returned.

## Legal status

In The Hindu, legal journalist Aaratrika Bhaumik argued that for military self-defence to be legal under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, the military actions have to "immediately" be reported to the UN Security Council (UNSC). Bhaumik interpreted the Indian foreign minister's 8 May briefing of 13 of the 15 UNSC member states to be "apparent adherence" to the Article 51 requirement (Sierra Leone had no envoy in New Delhi at the time and Pakistan was not briefed). She stated that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) interpreted the article to only be valid in the case of defence against attacks by non-state actors if responsibility for the attacks were attributed to a state. O. P. Jindal Global University legal scholar Prabhash Ranjan interpreted the foreign minister to have avoided references to international law and to have attributed the attack to Pakistan as a state. He viewed the foreign minister's legal argument to be based on a contested Indian view of the right to defence against non-state actors presented at a February 2021 Arria formula meeting. Ranjan viewed the Indian military strikes of 7 May 2025 to have satisfied the principles of necessity and proportionality.
On 9 May, Amnesty International referred to obligations under international humanitarian law forbidding "deliberate, indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks harming civilians or damaging civilian infrastructure" under the Geneva Conventions and condemned "the deliberate targeting and unlawful killing of civilians" in the 22 April Pahalgam attack. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) stated that the casualties of the Indian air strikes were "a grave violation of international human rights law and [could] constitute crimes against humanity". HRCP also commented on impunity in relation to enforced disappearances in Pakistan, the persecution of Ahmadis and blasphemy laws.
