Free AI video generators
All of the AI video generators in the above list are either free to use or have free plans/trials so that you can try them out without handing over your credit card details.

Types of AI video generation
Text-to-video
AI text-to-video generation allows users to create AI videos simply by describing a scene in text. The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation.

Image-to-video
Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames.

Video-to-video
Video-to-video AI video generation uses AI to enhance, modify, or transform existing videos rather than creating new ones from scratch. This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage.

Th‎e best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars
**Synthesia** is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with realistic talking AI avatars. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and the avatars speak more than 140 languages and accents.
