Despite its popularity and the nearly 200 million users it garnered in the U.S., TikTok has faced widespread criticism for exposing users to harmful content, potentially leading to various mental health issues, and for its addictive nature, particularly among children. Concerns have also been raised about the platform's association with both positive and negative mental health outcomes.\n\nThe platform has been embroiled in controversy due to national security concerns related to its parent company, ByteDance, and the potential for user data collection or content manipulation by the Chinese government. These concerns have led to significant legal and political challenges in the United States, culminating in a ban under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Despite its efforts to address these issues, TikTok officially went offline in the U.S. in 2025 after the Supreme Court upheld the ban, citing the unresolved national security concerns.\n\nIn summary, TikTok, once a dominant force in social media that reshaped how individuals, especially the youth, consume and share video content, has faced a complex array of challenges.
