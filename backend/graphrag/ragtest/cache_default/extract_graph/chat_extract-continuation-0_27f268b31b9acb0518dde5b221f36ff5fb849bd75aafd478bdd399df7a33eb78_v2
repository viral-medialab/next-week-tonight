That request was ultimately denied, and on January 17, the Supreme Court declined to take up the case.\nTikTok is expected to “go dark” when the ban officially takes effect on Sunday, January 19.\nWhat happens to TikTok users?\nAnyone in the US who tries to access TikTok after the ban takes effect will be redirected to a webpage explaining the ban and offering instructions on how to download any personal information they want to keep.\nTikTok has roughly 170 million monthly users in the US, many of whom have grown accustomed to spending hours on the app each day.\nThe ban may especially upset small business owners, who often rely on TikTok to advertise their services to a large audience.\nWhy is TikTok being banned?\nUS lawmakers have expressed concerns that TikTok’s Chinese ownership makes the app vulnerable to the Chinese government, which could use it to harvest data on US citizens or push pro-Beijing propaganda.\nIn March 2023, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before Congress, where he attempted to assuage lawmakers’ fears about the app’s ties to the Chinese government.\n“ByteDance is not an agent of China,” Chew said at the time. “It is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government, and it is a private, global company.”\nWhat are the possible solutions?\nOne possible resolution could be reviving the “Project Texas” national security arrangement, which would designate the Texas-based software company Oracle as a supervisor over data transactions in the US.\nLawmakers have also suggested that TikTok could resolve the issue by cutting ties with ByteDance.\n“Divestiture is obviously the key to addressing the lawmakers’ concerns,” US Representative Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, told CBS News in March 2023.\nWhat are the wider implications?\nThe TikTok situation could set a precedent for future US actions against other applications owned by Chinese entities or other foreign adversaries.\n“This is one of the most significant cases of internet regulation that we’ve seen in a long time,” Matt Perault, a professor at the University of North Carolina, told the Associated Press news agency.\n“It could signal a new approach in the US to regulating internet applications owned by foreign entities and other foreign adversaries,” Perault added.\nThe ban has been praised by some and criticised by others.\nHuman rights organisation Amnesty International has argued that the ban will not solve the broader issues related to Big Tech harms.\n“The US ban on TikTok is a blunt instrument that fails to address the real concerns around manipulation, privacy violations, and online harms,” Amnesty International said in a statement on Friday.\n“This decision will do nothing to alleviate the broader problems with Big Tech, which requires comprehensive regulation.”\nMeanwhile, social media consultants are advising TikTok users to back up their content and consider moving to established platforms like Facebook and Instagram.\n\nCitations:   \n[1] https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/what-to-know-about-tiktoks-looming-us-ban  \n\n\n\n---\nAnswer from Perplexity:
