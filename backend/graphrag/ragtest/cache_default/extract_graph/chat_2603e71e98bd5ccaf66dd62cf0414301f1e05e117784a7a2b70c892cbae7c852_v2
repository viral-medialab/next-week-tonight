Okolo, introduces a new writing series that aims to reimagine the concept of AI safety by centering the perspectives of the Global Majority, which includes regions such as Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East, Oceania, and much of Asia[1][6]. \n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Critique of Western-Centric Paradigms:** The article argues that AI safety to date has been shaped primarily by Western epistemologies. These frameworks often focus on abstract, long-term risks (like existential threats) and immediate technical issues (like bias and reliability), but they insufficiently address sociotechnical harms that disproportionately affect marginalized populations[1][6].\n\n- **Underrepresentation and Risks:** Global Majority communities are significantly underrepresented both in AI development teams and in the training data that shapes AI systems. As a result, AI technologies procured by governments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America are typically developed in Western contexts—raising concerns about cultural misalignment and insufficient data privacy protections[1][6].\n\n- **China’s Influence:** The article notes China’s increasing AI exports to the developing world. While this broadens access, it also calls for greater transparency to ensure imported systems align with local values and privacy standards[1].\n\n- **Call for Inclusive Approaches:** The series contends that equitable and robust AI safety requires incorporating diverse linguistic traditions, cultural practices, and value systems. It advocates for frameworks that recognize the specific risks, opportunities, and cultural contexts of Global Majority nations, moving beyond one-size-fits-all, Western-driven notions of AI “safety”[1][6].\n\n- **Recent Global Initiatives:** The piece highlights recent high-profile AI safety summits (Bletchley Park, Seoul, Paris), which have brought international attention to the topic but are criticized for lack of inclusivity and for being led by a small set of wealthy nations. The resulting declarations (like the Bletchley Declaration and Seoul AI Declaration) are seen as aspirational, with uncertain impact on advancing true equity in AI development[1].\n\n- **Need for Accountability and Inclusion:** The article stresses that for global AI safety to be meaningful, there must be concrete mechanisms for equitable participation, capacity-building, and resource allocation to Global Majority countries. This means shifting from rhetorical commitments to measurable actions and robust accountability standards[1][6].\n\n- **Objectives of the Series:** Throughout February 2025, Brookings will publish commentaries exploring how various Global Majority countries are interpreting and challenging Western approaches to AI safety. The series aims to:\n  - Deconstruct Western-centric assumptions.\n  - Highlight innovative local approaches to AI safety.\n  - Propose pathways for more diversified and inclusive policy frameworks.\n  - Foster a paradigm shift by engaging voices and expertise from the Global Majority.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe article concludes that only by including diverse perspectives and lived experiences—especially those from underrepresented regions—can the field of AI safety develop into a robust and equitable discipline. The upcoming writing series and related Brookings event (February 19, 2025) are positioned as a catalyst for rethinking how AI safety is defined, governed, and implemented on a global scale[1][6].\n\n---\n\nThis summary synthesizes the key arguments and direction of the Brookings article and planned series, drawing directly from the content and its official previews[1][6].\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
