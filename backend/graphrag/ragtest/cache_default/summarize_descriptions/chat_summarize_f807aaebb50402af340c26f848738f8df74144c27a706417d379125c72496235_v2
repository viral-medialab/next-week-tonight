Both are concerned with risk mitigation, ethical considerations, and the aim for trustworthiness and reliability in artificial intelligence systems. AI Safety focuses on ensuring that AI systems operate safely and as intended, without causing unintended harm. On the other hand, AI Security concentrates on protecting AI systems from external attacks and ensuring they are resilient against malicious threats. Together, these fields work in tandem to ensure the development and deployment of AI systems are both safe and secure, addressing both internal and external risks to achieve their objectives.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1744826495, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 300, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
