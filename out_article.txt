What are the Houthi rebels' capabilities for international attacks
 How can the Houthis retaliate against the United States
 Possible Houthi allies in retaliation against American forces















U.S. forces carried out another single strike early Saturday local time on a Houthi radar site, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the military operation. Yemen’s Houthi militants vowed Friday to continue targeting ships in the Red Sea to protest Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip, following U.S.- and British-led strikes on Yemen on Thursday. Israel presented its defense at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, as the United Nations’ top court considers South Africa’s genocide case against Israel over its actions in Gaza.

10:00 PM: Lawmakers say Biden should’ve gotten approval from Congress on strikes

Lawmakers from both parties criticized President Biden’s decision to authorize strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, arguing that he should have sought congressional approval first.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) wrote on X , formerly Twitter, that any president should ask for congressional authorization before military strikes. “That is Article I of the Constitution,” Khanna wrote. “I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House.”

Other Democrats — including Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), Val Hoyle (Ore.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.) — echoed Khanna’s criticism. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) said they agreed.

“I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression, but why is Congress not making calls to strike a foreign country with pre-meditation? Under what authority was this carried out?” Roy wrote on X .

When Biden was asked Friday about members of his own party saying he needed congressional authorization for Thursday’s strikes, the president replied: “They’re wrong.”

Biden previously cited his authority to carry out military strikes in Iraq and Syria in 2021 under Article II of the Constitution. Article I gives Congress the power to declare war, while Article II allows the president to use the military for defensive purposes as commander in chief.

“There’s not actually a strong case to prevent Biden from this kind of action,” Michael O’Hanlon, director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, told Reuters .

9:31 PM: Analysis from Dan Lamothe, Covers the U.S. military and Pentagon

Another single strike was carried out by U.S. forces Friday night on a Houthi radar site, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the military operation.

5:55 PM: Pentagon details Navy ships involved in attack on Houthis

A sprawling campaign of strikes in Yemen late Thursday was carried out by U.S. forces on an aircraft carrier, two destroyers, a cruiser and a submarine, a senior U.S. military official said Friday.

Fighter jets launched from the carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, with other strikes launched from the USS Gravely, the USS Mason and the USS Philippine Sea, said Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff. The Gravely and Mason are destroyers, while the Philippine Sea is a cruiser, which typically carries even more weapons.

Sims said that an Ohio-class submarine also participated in the strikes. The vessels carry ballistic missiles and typically keep a low profile below the ocean’s surface until needed.

4:52 PM: Biden says U.S. would respond if Houthis continue ‘outrageous behavior’

Speaking to reporters during a tour of small businesses near Allentown, Pa., President Biden suggested that the United States could retaliate further against the Houthis if the Yemeni group continued to attack commercial shipping.

“We will make sure we respond to the Houthis if they continue this outrageous behavior,” Biden said.

Asked by a reporter whether the Houthis were a terrorist group, the president replied: “I think they are.”

The Houthis had been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration in early 2021, just days before former president Donald Trump left office , but the Biden administration reversed the move the following month. The designation criminalizes dealings with the group.

In 2022, Biden told reporters he was considering reversing the decision and placing the Houthis back on the list of foreign terrorist organizations. “It’s under consideration,” Biden said, adding that ending the long-running civil war in Yemen would be difficult.

3:21 PM: U.S. forces struck more targets in Yemen than initially disclosed

The U.S.-led military coalition targeting Houthi militants in Yemen on Thursday night carried out even more strikes than initially disclosed, with an additional 12 locations targeted in a second round of airstrikes, a senior U.S. military official said.

Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims of the Pentagon’s Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters that, all told, more than 150 munitions were dropped, striking dozens of targets. The additional strikes were carried out in self-defense after U.S. forces observed additional Houthi weapons, Sims said.

Sims said he anticipates the Houthis, with weapons provided by Iran, will attempt to continue launching attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Following the strikes, another ballistic missile was launched by militants but did not strike any vessels, he said.

2:36 PM: Tesla, Volvo pause some production in Europe amid supply delays

Carmakers Tesla and Volvo said they were pausing some production in Europe because of shortages in components that have been delayed because of the rerouting of ships caused by the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.

A delay in the delivery of gearboxes “due to adjusted sea routes” have caused Volvo to stop production for three days next week at its plant in Ghent, Belgium, said Kristin Boldemann Wester, a spokesperson for the carmaker. She said that Volvo does not expect the halt in production would cause “any impact on our ability to reach global retail sales deliveries or production plans this year.”

Tesla said in a statement to Reuters that it would suspend most production at a factory near Berlin for nearly two weeks starting Jan. 29. “The armed conflicts in the Red Sea and the associated shifts in transport routes between Europe and Asia via the Cape of Good Hope are having an impact on production” at the plant in Gruenheide, southeast of Berlin, the statement said.

The pauses in production are among the first wave of major commercial impacts caused by the Houthi attacks, which have upended global shipping routes and threaten to wreak havoc on international commerce for months to come , experts say. Ikea said last month that it anticipated delays in receipt of its products because of the Houthi attacks.

12:02 PM: Initial indications show Yemen strikes had intended effect, Ryder says

The strikes carried out by the United States and Britain against Yemen’s Houthi militants appear to have “had good effect,” the Pentagon’s press secretary, Maj. General Patrick Ryder, said Friday, as the Iran-aligned group pledged to continue its attacks on shipping to protest Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.

Speaking to MSNBC on Friday, Ryder said the strikes “were very deliberate, very focused on degrading and disrupting the ability of the Houthis to conduct these kinds of strikes in the future.”

The Houthis have carried out 27 attacks on ships since mid-November, he said. “In early January, 14 nations and the United States all issued a warning to the Houthis that this type of illegal and reckless activity needed to stop or there would be consequences. And last night, there were consequences.”

“Initial indications are that we had good effect, but of course, we’re prepared to take additional action should we need to, to prevent these kinds of attacks from affecting not only the lives of mariners transiting this vital waterway, but also the international and global economy,” Ryder said.

British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said in an interview earlier Friday with the BBC that further strikes were not “immediately planned.”

Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, said in a video message Friday morning that 73 strikes hit the capital, Sanaa, and four other regions, killing five of the group’s fighters and wounding six.

“The American and British enemy bears full responsibility for its criminal aggression against the Yemeni people, and it will not go unpunished or unanswered,” he said.

“This brutal aggression will not dissuade Yemen from its position of support” for the Palestinian people, he added. He pledged that Houthi forces would continue to prevent ships from reaching Israeli territory.

9:26 AM: What qualifies as genocide? Breaking down the ICJ case against Israel.

South Africa has brought a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, alleging that Israel is violating international law by committing and failing to prevent genocidal acts “to destroy Palestinians in Gaza,” setting up a showdown in the court and in the court of public opinion as preliminary hearings on the case began Thursday.

Israel condemned the claims. “We are fighting terrorists, and we are fighting lies,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in remarks Thursday. “Today, again, we saw an upside-down world, in which the State of Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide.”

The case hinges on the definition of genocide and whether the judges find that Israel’s actions in and plans for the Gaza Strip meet that bar under international law.

It “can take years to resolve a case on the merits” at the International Court of Justice, said Adil Haque, an expert on ethics and law in wartime at Rutgers University.

8:13 AM: Israel rejects genocide allegations, says South Africa misrepresented facts

THE HAGUE — Israel on Friday rejected allegations that it is committing genocide in Gaza, arguing before the International Court of Justice that the soaring death toll there is an unavoidable consequence of its battle against a militant army that has embedded itself in civilian areas.

In a hearing Thursday, South Africa said Israel’s bombing and siege of Gaza showed its “intent” to commit genocide against Palestinians and urged the court to order a stop to the violence.

In three hours of remarks on Friday, the Israeli delegation dismissed the plausibility of genocide in Gaza and argued against the orders requested by South Africa. Israel claimed that the South African case misrepresented facts and could put Israeli civilians at risk.

Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the court that Israel is “in a war it did not start and did not want. A war in which Israel is defending itself against Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist organizations whose brutality knows no bounds.”

This week’s hearings will not establish whether Israel has committed genocide. Rather, judges will assess South Africa’s call for provisional measures — interim steps aimed at stopping the situation in Gaza from deteriorating further while the case plays out.

On Thursday, Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, an Irish lawyer on the South African team, argued that the court should urgently order such measures. She cited the risk of “irreparable” harm to Palestinians in Gaza.

Omri Sender, representing the Israeli side, countered that the situation is not as urgent as South Africa suggested, noting that “the scope and intensity of the hostilities has been decreasing.”

Christopher Staker, also representing Israel, said South Africa’s call for provisional orders is unwarranted, prejudicial and would hand an advantage to Hamas, putting Israeli civilians at risk.

The International Court of Justice was established after World War II as a means to settle disputes between nations. In 1948, genocide was made a crime under international law, and the court was empowered to determine whether states have committed it.

The court’s rulings are legally binding but are hard to enforce. Legal analysts said it could be years before the court rules on this case, but a decision on provisional measures could come within weeks.

7:45 AM: No more Yemen strikes ‘immediately planned,’ U.K. minister says

British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said no further military action against Houthi rebels in Yemen is imminent after Thursday night’s strikes.

“We were confident that these limited, proportionate, necessary strikes that went in last night was necessary to disrupt the Houthis’ ability to attack our warships that are protecting shipping in the Red Sea,” he told “BBC Breakfast.”

Four British Typhoon jets joined the United States in hitting targets in Yemen overnight. They struck two sites, both of which had been used to launch drone and missile attacks, Heappey said, adding that further strikes were not “immediately planned.”

He defended Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to carry out the strikes without approval of Britain’s Parliament, saying that such decisions have to be made “based on the military, strategic and operational requirements.”

Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf is among those who have criticized the British leader for not consulting Parliament on the strikes.

6:50 AM: Palestinians say ICJ hearing makes them ‘feel seen for the first time’

JERUSALEM — For many Palestinians, the global airing of South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide in its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza was not just welcome as a chance to stem the violence that has killed tens of thousands. It was also a rare public reckoning of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory and policies they view as apartheid, they said.

“We feel seen for the first time,” said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and onetime adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. “It was no longer just Palestinians versus Israel; it was another state putting its diplomatic relations on the line to make the case.”

Supporters gathered in Nelson Mandela Square in Ramallah, the West Bank, on Thursday, waving Palestinian and South African flags after a South African legal team presented its arguments to the tribunal in The Hague. Social media came alive with celebratory postings.

The proceedings were big news in Israel, where detailed arguments against the military’s actions don’t always get a wide airing. Commentators mostly dismissed the legal case, saying it largely ignored the brutal Oct. 7 attacks that killed about 1,200 people and swept almost 250 hostages into Gaza, where more than 100 hostages are still thought to be held.

Buttu, who helped present a case against the separation barriers that Israel built to isolate West Bank communities, said a failure to issue an order curtailing military actions in Gaza would amount to a failure of the international legal system.

But even having the arguments laid out so methodically amounts to a milestone for Palestinians, she said.

“It’s already done something important,” she said. “This isn’t just about the genocide convention; it’s much broader than that.”

6:28 AM: Mixed global reaction to U.S., U.K. airstrikes in Yemen targeting Houthis

The announcement of U.S. and British strikes on Yemen’s Houthi militants, a group that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea in response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza , was met with a mixture of support, concern and condemnation around the globe.

In a joint statement , the governments of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States said Thursday’s action “demonstrated a shared commitment to freedom of navigation, international commerce, and defending the lives of mariners from illegal and unjustifiable attacks.”

Russia’s mission to the United Nations said on Telegram that it has requested an urgent meeting of the Security Council, which it expects to take place Friday afternoon.

Iran, which has avoided direct confrontation with the United States in the months since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack plunged the region into war, condemned the strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen as “a clear violation of Yemen’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” The intervention in Yemen, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said, was an attempt by the United States “to divert the attention of the people of the world” from the ongoing war in Gaza.

Saudi Arabia warned of the risks of escalation and said it is “closely monitoring” the situation in the Red Sea and inside Yemen “with great concern,” according to a Foreign Ministry statement . Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. partner in the region, is trying to conclude a peace deal with the Houthis and formally end its military intervention in Yemen’s long civil war.

Badr Albusaidi, the foreign minister of Oman, wrote on social media that the strikes in neighboring Yemen went “against our advice and will only add fuel to an extremely dangerous situation. I urge all parties to exercise restraint and focus on a ceasefire in Gaza now.”

In the United States, there was a mixed response from lawmakers.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) said in a statement that he was “pleased the president, in coordination with our allies, finally took action against the Iran-backed Houthis.” Others, including Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Val Hoyle (D-Ore.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) criticized President Biden for authorizing the strikes without congressional approval.

6:21 AM: Analysis from Emily Rauhala, Brussels bureau chief

Yesterday, South Africa argued that Israel is showing “genocidal intent” in the Gaza Strip. Today, the Israeli delegation is arguing that this intent does not exist, citing, among other things, phone calls and leafleting to warn Palestinians of incoming fire; evacuation orders; and food trucks entering Gaza.

5:01 AM: Israel argues South Africa’s case threatens its right to defend itself

THE HAGUE — Israel has started its three-hour presentation before the International Court of Justice in response to South Africa’s charges of genocide in Gaza. A lawyer for Israel, Tal Becker, focused on Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, including the murder of civilians and the taking of hostages.

Becker said Israel will highlight footage from that day because “it is impossible to understand the armed conflict in Gaza without understanding the nature of the threat Israel is facing.”

He argued that South Africa’s call for provisional measures to stop the violence in Gaza is a threat to Israel’s right to defend itself.

On Thursday, the South African delegation recognized Israel’s right to self-defense, but said the Israeli bombardment and siege of Gaza was disproportionate and showed “genocidal intent.”

“No matter how monstrous or appalling an attack or provocation, genocide is never a permitted response,” said Vaughan Lowe, a member of South Africa’s delegation.

4:03 AM: Analysis from Emily Rauhala, Brussels bureau chief

The second day of hearings is now underway here in The Hague, with Israel set to deliver its three-hour response to South Africa’s claim that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

3:46 AM: Who are the Houthis, and why are they attacking ships in the Red Sea?

Houthi militants in Yemen have escalated attacks on ships traversing the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest waterways, drawing the ire of the United States, Britain and a coalition of countries invested in keeping the route open and safe for commerce. Since Israel declared war against Hamas in retaliation for its Oct. 7 cross-border attack, the Iranian-backed Houthis have used their base in northern Yemen to fire missiles and drones at several ships passing through the Red Sea.

The Houthis are a rebel movement that took control of Yemen’s capital in 2014. They are formally known as Ansar Allah, or the “partisans of God.” After deposing the U.S.-allied government in Sanaa, the Houthis forced then-President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia, elevating the group to international prominence and triggering a years-long civil war.

Here’s what to know about the Houthis.

3:44 AM: Israel to present defense in case at International Court of Justice

THE HAGUE — Israel will on Friday present its defense at the International Court of Justice , offering its counter to South Africa’s claims that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and must be stopped.

On Thursday, South African lawyers argued that Israel’s bombing and siege of Gaza showed a “genocidal intent” and called on the U.N. court to order Israel to stop the violence. To make their case, the South African delegation cited the words of senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Israel has categorically rejected South Africa’s allegations. On Friday, in three hours of presentations, the Israeli delegation is expected to argue that they are acting in self-defense following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and to show graphic video evidence from that day.

Critically, this week’s hearings will not assess whether Israeli has committed genocide. Instead, judges are weighing South Africa’s call for “provisional measures” to prevent further violence while the case plays out.

While any ruling on whether Israel’s actions amounted to genocide could take years, the court could rule on provisional measures within weeks, and could order Israel to change its conduct of the war, legal experts said. South Africa has focused on establishing the risk of genocide happening, and hence the obligation to prevent it.

The rare public reckoning for Israel is playing out under tight security in the Netherlands, with both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli assembling outside The Hague’s Peace Palace to rally support to their sides.

1:20 AM: U.S.-led coalition strikes Iran-aligned Houthi militants in Yemen

U.S. and coalition forces struck Iran-aligned Houthi militants in Yemen on Thursday, a dramatic escalation after the group ignored warnings from the Biden administration and other governments to stop attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea.

The operation follows weeks of hostility as the Houthis, protesting Israel’s military campaign in Gaza , have disrupted global trade by making the vital waterway a dangerous place for ships to transit. The group, which functions as the de-facto government in parts of Yemen, has carried out numerous attacks since November, officials have said, leading to repeated distress calls and routine altercations with U.S. and partner nations’ warships dispatched to the region in response.

Senior U.S. officials have blamed Iran for having “aided and abetted” the crisis, saying the Houthis would be incapable of threatening the shipping route if not for Tehran’s technological and intelligence support.

In the event of the Houthis in Yemen seeking to retaliate against American forces for their strikes, I foresee a sequence of complex geopolitical actions and reactions. The Houthis, fueled by a combination of strategic necessity and an effort to showcase their resilience, might thrust themselves into conspicuously bolder military undertakings. Should this be the case, my prediction encompasses several specific developments grounded in historical patterns, regional alliances, and the current military-political landscape:

1. Increase in Asymmetric Warfare Tactics: The Houthis, undeterred, may escalate their use of asymmetric warfare, targeting American assets or allies in the region. They could deploy advanced drone and missile technology, potentially sourced from Iran, aimed at vital shipping lanes in the Red Sea, further menacing international maritime security. The Port of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and vessels associated with American companies could become focal points of such warfare.

2. Cyber Operations: There may be a surge in cyber operations, with American and allied infrastructure being targeted by sophisticated cyberattacks designed to disrupt critical military or civilian systems, a domain in which plausible deniability can be maintained.

3. Proxy Engagement: The Houthis might activate or strengthen alliances with other Iran-backed militia groups in the Middle East, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon or certain factions within Iraq. This could involve coordinated rocket attacks or subversion operations against American bases, embassies, or interest points in the region like the U.S. military base at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar or the American Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq.

4. Diplomatic Strain: The Houthi retaliation could cause significant strain on diplomatic relations between the United States and Yemen's neighbors, particularly if retaliatory tactics result in collateral damage to assets or citizens of countries such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, pushing these nations to lobby for a more assertive U.S. stance against Houthi aggression.

5. Humanitarian Crisis Escalation: An intense and prolonged conflict may exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation in Yemen. The United Nations, already contending with one of the world's worst humanitarian crises in Yemen, will be pressured to intensify relief efforts and call for a ceasefire.

6. Regional Army Mobilization: In response to Houthi actions, we could witness an increase in military preparedness from regional powers such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and possibly the involvement of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in a more direct intervention to dissuade further Houthi aggression, with joint naval exercises or missile defense system deployments.

7. International Mediation Efforts: The United Nations Security Council, including permanent members such as China and Russia, might be propelled to engage more deeply in mediation efforts to deescalate the tensions. The United Nations might appoint a special envoy, like former UN Under-Secretary-General Martin Griffiths, to negotiate between the parties.

8. U.S. Congressional Involvement: The U.S. Congress, prompted by the retaliatory measures from the Houthis, may be compelled to reassess the legitimacy of continued unilateral military actions without explicit authorization, leading to heated debates and potentially new legislative measures concerning war powers and military engagements abroad.

A caveat to note is that predicting human and geopolitical behavior, particularly within the intense complexity of Middle Eastern politics and war, is subject to numerous unknowns and variables that can alter any expected outcomes dramatically. However, these predictions are crafted with an eye toward historical context, current tensions, and strategic interests of the relevant actors.















Analyzing Geopolitical Ripples: The Potential Consequences of Houthi Retaliation Against U.S. Forces

The query at hand appears to emerge from concerns regarding escalating tensions between the Houthi rebels in Yemen and American forces, following recent U.S. strikes against Houthi radar sites. This speculative question aims to probe the potential outcomes of a tit-for-tat response and its implications for regional stability, international relations, and global commerce. In the broader context, it is crucial because it touches upon the law of armed conflict, the role of Congress in military decisions, the precarious nature of maritime security, and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen.

The Houthis' promise of retaliation comes on the heels of intensifying military operations and a pronounced declaration to target Red Sea shipping lanes, a linchpin for international trade. If the Houthis were to follow through on their threats, we could witness repercussions in multiple domains:

Firstly, from a military perspective, an escalation in asymmetric warfare is inevitable. The Houthis may ramp up missile and drone attacks, leveraging aid from Iran, and further threaten maritime security. American assets and allies might see intensified attacks, provoking a potential increase in military presence from the U.S. and others in the fragile Red Sea theater.

The second area of impact is diplomacy. American unilateral action without congressional approval, as underlined by bipartisan criticism, raises substantial questions about war powers and the executive branch’s scope of authority under the U.S. Constitution. This debate is likely to spur rigorous discourse in Congress and perhaps lead to legislative efforts to redefine the parameters of military engagement.

Moreover, there are anticipated implications for the humanitarian situation in Yemen. A retaliatory spiral would undoubtedly inflate the humanitarian toll, exacerbating the suffering in a country already battered by years of civil conflict. Relief operations would struggle amidst a resurgence in combat, driving up the urgency for international mediation and aid.

Strategically, heightened Houthi aggression could impel regional military mobilization and collective security efforts via the GCC, straining diplomatic ties with Iran and pressuring alliances in the Middle East.

Additionally, we cannot overlook the economic impact, particularly in commercial terms. The already observed disruption, with Volvo and Tesla indicating production halts due to rerouted supply chains, underlines the profound effect of conflict on global commerce. This disruption could widen, affecting more industries and leading to significant financial ramifications.

Lastly, global reactions could vary widely, from outright support for American-led actions to vehement condemnation, laying bare the diverging interests and alliances that traverse the complex web of international politics.

One must concede that the fabric of the Middle East is densely woven with a multitude of actors, each with their narrative. Any Houthi retaliation would thread through this highly complex regional tapestry, potentially altering patterns in unexpected ways. The future, while uncertain, is sure to be shaped by a spectrum of geopolitical forces, with each maneuver prompting a succession of actions and reactions, the ultimate objectives, and outcomes of which are as unpredictable as the terrain upon which they play out.
