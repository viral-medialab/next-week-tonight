What if the Houthis in Yemen retaliate against the American for their strikes?















'This live coverage has ended. For the latest updates, please go here .

The United States fired its second round of strikes in less than 24 hours against Houthi militants in Yemen on Thursday morning, targeting “a couple of anti-ship missiles that we had reason to believe were being prepared for imminent fire into the southern Red Sea,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. Israel stepped up raids in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, saying security forces had been operating in the Tulkarm refugee camp for over 35 hours.

8:38 PM: U.S. launches new round of strikes against Yemen’s Houthis; Houthis attack another ship

The United States fired another round of strikes Thursday morning against Houthi militants in Yemen , targeting “a couple of anti-ship missiles that we had reason to believe were being prepared for imminent fire into the southern Red Sea,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. Later in the day, the Houthis attacked another U.S.-owned ship — the third attack on commercial shipping vessels in three days, the United States said.

The U.S. strikes, which the Pentagon said were carried out by Navy fighter jets, were the second in less than 24 hours . The U.S. Navy on Wednesday night struck 14 missiles it said the Houthis had “loaded to be fired” against merchant vessels and American warships, according to U.S. Central Command.

Kirby said President Biden authorized the strikes as commander in chief under Article II authorities in the Constitution, and under Article 51 of the U.N. charter authorizing self-defense.

Houthi militants have been undeterred by U.S. strikes, continuing to attack commercial vessels. On Thursday night local time in Yemen, Houthi militants launched two anti-ship ballistic missiles at M/V Chem Ranger, a U.S.-owned, Greek-operated, Marshall Island-flagged tanker ship, the U.S. Central Command said in a statement. Though the crew watched the missiles impact nearby water, the ship and its crew were not hurt or damaged, the statement continued.

The Houthis have connected their wave of attacks to the war on Gaza, saying they will continue to launch in protest of Israel’s campaign against Hamas.

7:47 PM: How Israel’s war in Gaza became a tangled crisis spanning the Middle East

Israel’s war in Gaza is at the center of a simmering regional crisis that has threatened to boil over in recent days, which have seen a string of strikes across the Middle East — some direct reverberations of Israel’s effort to root out Hamas.

As Israel targeted Hezbollah sites deep in southern Lebanon and the United States conducted a new round of strikes on what officials said were Houthi missile sites in Yemen, Iran launched strikes at what it said was an Israeli intelligence site in Iraq’s Kurdistan province and a militant site in Pakistan — prompting angry objections from both governments. Iran has also launched strikes into Syria, and its proxy groups in Iran and Syria have targeted U.S. troops there.

As strikes cascade, experts warn that a simple miscalculation could quickly spiral out of control.

“They’re playing a very dangerous game — it’s chicken, basically,” Joost Hiltermann, a Middle East expert at the International Crisis Group, said this month of the various governments and militant groups increasingly enmeshed in regional tensions. “Any miscalculation, any miscommunication, any accidental strike could trigger a major escalation.”

Some suggest that a regional conflict is already underway. Late last month, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told a parliamentary committee that the country was defending itself in a “multi-arena” war that went beyond Gaza and the West Bank.

“I say here in the most explicit way: Anyone who acts against us is a potential target. There is no immunity for anyone,” he said.

Here are some of the flash points across the region.

6:55 PM: Netanyahu says Israel won’t end war until ‘complete victory’ is achieved

In an evening address to the nation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back on growing international calls for an end to the conflict: “We strive to achieve total victory,” he said. “This is not just a matter of hitting Hamas, this is not another round with Hamas — this is a complete victory.”

He said that ending the war without achieving Israel’s goals “will damage Israel’s security for generations” and “will send a message of weakness and encourage our enemies to think that they can defeat us, and then the next massacre will be only a matter of time.” So, Israel will continue to “fight with full force” until it achieves its goals.

Israel, he said, “must maintain security control over all territory west of the Jordan river.”

Later in the day, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller offered a different vision, saying there was “no way” to solve Israel’s long-term challenges and ensure lasting security “without the establishment of a Palestinian state.”

Total victory to Netanyahu also meant, the prime minister said, the elimination of “terrorist leaders,” destroying Hamas’s military and governing capabilities, returning hostages, and ensuring Gaza is demilitarized and “under Israel’s full security control, with Israeli control over everything that enters Gaza.”

“We will not stop. We will not finish the war before returning our loved ones home; we will not finish the war before total victory,” Netanyahu said.

“The US supports a two-state solution. It’s the only way to ensure security, dignity, and peace for both Israelis and Palestinians,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) later said in a post on X . “Netanyahu’s saying the quiet part out loud — it’s dangerous and directly contradicts US policy. Aid must be conditioned on working toward peace.”

5:57 PM: Why Gaza keeps losing communications

BEIRUT — Israel’s war on Hamas has deprived people in Gaza of food, water, electricity and shelter.

It’s also disrupted communications. Gaza’s cellphone network had struggled before the conflict. Now, under Israeli bombardment and the mass displacement of Gazans, it’s failing as people are trying to connect with loved ones and secure resources.

Communications blackouts have also stymied aid organizations and emergency workers trying to coordinate with the local population and with each other. And for Gaza’s journalists, the blackouts are an impediment as they try to inform the world about suffering in the enclave.

2:01 PM: Analysis from Karen DeYoung, Associate editor and senior national security correspondent

Iran’s strike on Pakistan was a “reckless attack” and “example of Iran’s destabilizing behavior in the region,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. “While the United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, Pakistan is considered a U.S. partner in the region, with “major non-NATO ally” status. He said he was not aware of any “pre-notification that we received at all” from Pakistan before its retaliatory strike against Iran on Thursday.

12:09 PM: Pakistan launches retaliatory attack on Iran in latest escalation of regional tensions

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan launched a series of retaliatory strikes Thursday on militants in Iran’s Sistan and Baluchistan province, its Foreign Ministry said , amid an increasingly tense situation in the Middle East that now appears to be straining relations between the nuclear-armed Pakistan and its neighbor.

Iranian state media reported that at least nine people, including three women and four children, were killed in the strikes, while Pakistani officials cited only the deaths of “a number of terrorists.”

The Pakistani attacks, carried out with “drones, rockets, loitering munitions and standoff weapons,” were launched in response to Iranian strikes inside Pakistan on Tuesday that killed two children, according to Pakistani officials. Both sides said they had targeted separatist militant groups that pose cross-border threats.

While the Pakistan-Iran border has seen occasional outbreaks of violence in recent years, this week’s attacks came amid growing concerns over rising instability in the region following the launch of Israel’s war with Hamas militants, who are supported by Iran. Over the past week, the United States carried out several strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have been attacking shipping in the Red Sea; Iran, meanwhile, attacked targets in Iraq and Syria earlier this week.

9:55 AM: Strike on displaced Gazans in Rafah kills 16 people

RAFAH — A strike Thursday on a home in Rafah, in southern Gaza, that was housing displaced people killed at least 16 people, among them children and a pregnant woman, bystanders said at the scene.

In the aftermath, white body bags piled up outside of Najjar hospital, where the dead and injured were taken. Family members wept and prayed. The hospital had no available morgue to store the bodies. Countless Gazans have been hastily laid to rest in mass graves.

Talat Barhoum, a doctor at Rafah’s Najjar Hospital, confirmed the death toll in a conversation with the Associated Press and said many more had been injured.

“They were suffering from hunger, they were dying from hunger, and now they have also been hit,” Mahmoud Qassim, a relative of some of those killed, told the AP .

Thursday’s strike, the source of which The Post could not independently verify, left a scene of chaos, as neighbors climbed over the rubble to help the injured. Israel has repeatedly told civilians to flee to Rafah for their safety and about half of Gaza’s 2.2 million residents have crammed into the city on the Egyptian border — even as deadly Israeli strikes continue there.

8:33 AM: Hostage families accuse Netanyahu of scuttling releases

Several relatives of hostages have this week publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government’s pace of progress toward releases.

At a news conference Wednesday, Liz Hirsh Naftali — whose grandniece, Abigail Edan , turned 4 in captivity before being freed Nov. 26 — rebuked Netanyahu for allowing more than 130 remaining hostages to languish in Hamas captivity in Gaza. Naftali also accused Netanyahu of scuttling deals that would have seen more hostages freed for the sake of advancing his political goals and wanting “to keep this war going to remain in office.”

The United States has a responsibility to get tough with Israel, Naftali added. “President Biden has been very clear that he and the U.S. government are friends of Israel and the Israeli people. But sometimes friends have to deliver hard messages,” she said.

Ruby Chen, the father of Israeli American hostage Itay Chen, told reporters at the event that he thought Netanyahu was “responsible, because it was on his watch what happened on Oct. 7, and he has the authority of bringing this to the finish line.”

The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office on Thursday denied the claim that Netanyahu was delaying hostage releases.

In Israel, the sister of slain hostage Itay Svirsky told Israeli Army Radio that she wished her brother had been killed on Oct. 7 rather than suffered as a hostage. “That way he would have been saved from 99 days of fear and death,” Merav Svirsky said.

The comments came as freed Israeli-Argentinian hostage Sharon Aloni Cunio told CNN on Wednesday that she was held in Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis “up until the end,” when she was freed along with her 3-year-old daughters in November in exchange for Palestinians held in Israel.

Cunio, 34, said she was held in one of three “exam rooms” 12 square feet in size, which she shared with about 10 other hostages. The Washington Post could not independently verify Cunio’s claims, and Netanyahu’s office declined to comment. Many hostages have said they were treated or held in hospitals, as well as mosques, schools and other civilian infrastructure.

Cunio’s husband, David, remains a hostage. The family was taken on Oct. 7 from their home in the Nir Oz kibbutz in southern Israel.

7:33 AM: Israeli troops withdraw from Nasser Hospital area in south, U.N. office says

Israeli forces withdrew from the vicinity of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis on Wednesday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said , after heavy fighting and bombardment in the southern Gazan city this week that the office said destroyed residential buildings and a cemetery.

Al Amal Hospital in Khan Younis was badly damaged by strikes in its vicinity on Tuesday, OCHA said. Artillery shelling near Nasser led to some munitions falling inside the hospital complex, but no casualties were reported, the office added.

A Jordanian field hospital in the city was heavily damaged Wednesday, and one staff member and one patient were injured, the Jordanian army told local media. The Israel Defense Forces told the Times of Israel that the field hospital was not damaged.

As thousands of displaced civilians and patients fled Nasser Hospital this week, Doctors Without Borders said it was “extremely concerned” about the safety of its staff and patients there. On Tuesday night, Israeli forces bombed an area near Nasser Hospital without giving a prior evacuation order, the organization said, citing a surgeon working there. Thousands sheltering and receiving care “fled in a panic,” it said.

Earlier in the day, the IDF accused Hamas of launching a rocket from within the hospital grounds, raising fears that an operation was imminent.

Nasser is the largest partially functional hospital remaining in the Gaza Strip, according to the United Nations. Thirteen of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are partially functional, two were minimally functioning, and 21 were not working at all, the World Health Organization said in December.

6:24 AM: At least 10 Palestinians killed in two days of Israeli raids in the West Bank, health officials say

JERUSALEM — Israeli forces stepped up raids across the occupied West Bank on Thursday, a day after Palestinian officials reported airstrikes in two refugee camps that they said killed at least nine people. At least one other Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire and 12 others were injured as of Thursday morning, the Palestine Red Crescent said.

Israeli military operations centered in the northern Tulkarm and Nur Shams refugee camps for a second day Thursday. Local media shared videos of Israeli bulldozers and tanks in torn-up streets, and reported on raids and clashes between Palestinian fighters and Israeli forces. A 27-year-old died of a gunshot wound in his abdomen in Tulkarm, the Ramallah-based Palestinian Health Ministry said.

The Israel Defense Forces told The Washington Post on Thursday that it, Shin Bet and border police were “continuing an ongoing counterterrorism operation in the Tulkarm Camp for over 35 hours” and that security forces were “continuing to operate in the city.” The IDF said it “exposed dozens of explosive devices” concealed under roads, located military equipment, struck an explosives laboratory and apprehended more than 15 people. In Nur Shams, there was “an activity to expose explosive devices using engineering tools” and exchanges of fire with Palestinian gunmen, the IDF said in a separate statement.

Elsewhere, Palestinians reported on Israeli raids in the village of Zawata outside Nablus, in Amari refugee camp near Ramallah and in Bani Naim village outside Hebron in the south. An IDF spokesperson told The Post that Israeli forces entered Amari to arrest a wanted person and Bani Naim for “a routine activity.” In both cases, a “violent riot was instigated” and “hits were identified,” said the spokesperson, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per military protocol.

Israel intensified raids and arrests across the West Bank after Hamas’s October attack, escalating intensive military campaigns that began in the spring of 2022. Israeli forces have killed more than 40 Palestinian fighters and civilians in the West Bank in 2024 alone, according to Palestinian health officials, and more than 320 people overall since Oct. 7 — a rate not seen in years.

The IDF has increasingly conducted lethal airstrikes in the West Bank since Oct. 7. On Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike killed four people in the Balata refugee camp near Nablus, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The IDF said the dead included the head of a local militant cell who “planned to carry out an imminent, large-scale, terrorist attack.” The IDF did not provide details on the alleged plans.

Hours later, an airstrike in Tulkarm killed at least five Palestinians, among them two 17-year-olds, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The IDF said the two had thrown explosives at its forces and one Israeli reservist was seriously injured by gunfire.

The Palestine Red Crescent said Israel prevented its ambulances from reaching Balata and Tulkarm on Wednesday. Israeli forces also fired toward its teams, injuring two ambulance drivers in Tulkarm, the group said.

12:58 AM: U.S. Navy carries out new round of strikes against Houthis in Yemen

The U.S. Navy launched a new round of missile strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen, targeting about a dozen sites in a growing campaign meant to stifle repeated attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, U.S. officials said late Wednesday.

U.S. forces carried out the strikes on 14 missiles that the Houthis had “loaded to be fired,” military officials said in a statement released by U.S. Central Command. The missiles were on launch rails and “presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships and could have been fired at any time,” prompting U.S. forces to strike in self-defense, according to the statement.

Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla, the head of Central Command, said in the statement that the Houthis “continue to endanger international mariners and disrupt the commercial shipping lanes in the Southern Red and adjacent waterways.”

“We will continue to take actions to protect the lives of innocent mariners and we will always protect our people,” Kurilla said. He called the militants “Houthi terrorists” in language that appeared to reflect the Biden administration’s decision, announced Wednesday, to put the militants on its list of specially designated terrorists .

The strikes were carried out with Tomahawk missiles, two defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. At least one warship and one submarine were involved, the officials said.

Yemen’s Houthi militants vowed Friday to continue targeting ships in the Red Sea to protest Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip, following U.S.- and British-led strikes on Yemen on Thursday. Israel presented its defense at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, as the United Nations’ top court considers South Africa’s genocide case against Israel over its actions in Gaza.

10:00 PM: Lawmakers say Biden should’ve gotten approval from Congress on strikes

Lawmakers from both parties criticized President Biden’s decision to authorize strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, arguing that he should have sought congressional approval first.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) wrote on X , formerly Twitter, that any president should ask for congressional authorization before military strikes. “That is Article I of the Constitution,” Khanna wrote. “I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House.”

Other Democrats — including Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), Val Hoyle (Ore.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.) — echoed Khanna’s criticism. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) said they agreed.

“I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression, but why is Congress not making calls to strike a foreign country with pre-meditation? Under what authority was this carried out?” Roy wrote on X .

When Biden was asked Friday about members of his own party saying he needed congressional authorization for Thursday’s strikes, the president replied: “They’re wrong.”

Biden previously cited his authority to carry out military strikes in Iraq and Syria in 2021 under Article II of the Constitution. Article I gives Congress the power to declare war, while Article II allows the president to use the military for defensive purposes as commander in chief.

“There’s not actually a strong case to prevent Biden from this kind of action,” Michael O’Hanlon, director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, told Reuters .

5:55 PM: Pentagon details Navy ships involved in attack on Houthis

A sprawling campaign of strikes in Yemen late Thursday was carried out by U.S. forces on an aircraft carrier, two destroyers, a cruiser and a submarine, a senior U.S. military official said Friday.

Fighter jets launched from the carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, with other strikes launched from the USS Gravely, the USS Mason and the USS Philippine Sea, said Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff. The Gravely and Mason are destroyers, while the Philippine Sea is a cruiser, which typically carries even more weapons.

Sims said that an Ohio-class submarine also participated in the strikes. The vessels carry ballistic missiles and typically keep a low profile below the ocean’s surface until needed.

4:52 PM: Biden says U.S. would respond if Houthis continue ‘outrageous behavior’

Speaking to reporters during a tour of small businesses near Allentown, Pa., President Biden suggested that the United States could retaliate further against the Houthis if the Yemeni group continued to attack commercial shipping.

“We will make sure we respond to the Houthis if they continue this outrageous behavior,” Biden said.

Asked by a reporter whether the Houthis were a terrorist group, the president replied: “I think they are.”

The Houthis had been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration in early 2021, just days before former president Donald Trump left office , but the Biden administration reversed the move the following month. The designation criminalizes dealings with the group.

In 2022, Biden told reporters he was considering reversing the decision and placing the Houthis back on the list of foreign terrorist organizations. “It’s under consideration,” Biden said, adding that ending the long-running civil war in Yemen would be difficult.

3:21 PM: U.S. forces struck more targets in Yemen than initially disclosed

The U.S.-led military coalition targeting Houthi militants in Yemen on Thursday night carried out even more strikes than initially disclosed, with an additional 12 locations targeted in a second round of airstrikes, a senior U.S. military official said.

Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims of the Pentagon’s Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters that, all told, more than 150 munitions were dropped, striking dozens of targets. The additional strikes were carried out in self-defense after U.S. forces observed additional Houthi weapons, Sims said.

Sims said he anticipates the Houthis, with weapons provided by Iran, will attempt to continue launching attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Following the strikes, another ballistic missile was launched by militants but did not strike any vessels, he said.

2:36 PM: Tesla, Volvo pause some production in Europe amid supply delays

Carmakers Tesla and Volvo said they were pausing some production in Europe because of shortages in components that have been delayed because of the rerouting of ships caused by the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.

A delay in the delivery of gearboxes “due to adjusted sea routes” have caused Volvo to stop production for three days next week at its plant in Ghent, Belgium, said Kristin Boldemann Wester, a spokesperson for the carmaker. She said that Volvo does not expect the halt in production would cause “any impact on our ability to reach global retail sales deliveries or production plans this year.”

Tesla said in a statement to Reuters that it would suspend most production at a factory near Berlin for nearly two weeks starting Jan. 29. “The armed conflicts in the Red Sea and the associated shifts in transport routes between Europe and Asia via the Cape of Good Hope are having an impact on production” at the plant in Gruenheide, southeast of Berlin, the statement said.

The pauses in production are among the first wave of major commercial impacts caused by the Houthi attacks, which have upended global shipping routes and threaten to wreak havoc on international commerce for months to come , experts say. Ikea said last month that it anticipated delays in receipt of its products because of the Houthi attacks.

12:02 PM: Initial indications show Yemen strikes had intended effect, Ryder says

The strikes carried out by the United States and Britain against Yemen’s Houthi militants appear to have “had good effect,” the Pentagon’s press secretary, Maj. General Patrick Ryder, said Friday, as the Iran-aligned group pledged to continue its attacks on shipping to protest Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.

Speaking to MSNBC on Friday, Ryder said the strikes “were very deliberate, very focused on degrading and disrupting the ability of the Houthis to conduct these kinds of strikes in the future.”

The Houthis have carried out 27 attacks on ships since mid-November, he said. “In early January, 14 nations and the United States all issued a warning to the Houthis that this type of illegal and reckless activity needed to stop or there would be consequences. And last night, there were consequences.”

“Initial indications are that we had good effect, but of course, we’re prepared to take additional action should we need to, to prevent these kinds of attacks from affecting not only the lives of mariners transiting this vital waterway, but also the international and global economy,” Ryder said.

British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said in an interview earlier Friday with the BBC that further strikes were not “immediately planned.”

Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, said in a video message Friday morning that 73 strikes hit the capital, Sanaa, and four other regions, killing five of the group’s fighters and wounding six.

“The American and British enemy bears full responsibility for its criminal aggression against the Yemeni people, and it will not go unpunished or unanswered,” he said.

“This brutal aggression will not dissuade Yemen from its position of support” for the Palestinian people, he added. He pledged that Houthi forces would continue to prevent ships from reaching Israeli territory.

9:26 AM: What qualifies as genocide? Breaking down the ICJ case against Israel.

South Africa has brought a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, alleging that Israel is violating international law by committing and failing to prevent genocidal acts “to destroy Palestinians in Gaza,” setting up a showdown in the court and in the court of public opinion as preliminary hearings on the case began Thursday.

Israel condemned the claims. “We are fighting terrorists, and we are fighting lies,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in remarks Thursday. “Today, again, we saw an upside-down world, in which the State of Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide.”

The case hinges on the definition of genocide and whether the judges find that Israel’s actions in and plans for the Gaza Strip meet that bar under international law.

It “can take years to resolve a case on the merits” at the International Court of Justice, said Adil Haque, an expert on ethics and law in wartime at Rutgers University.

8:13 AM: Israel rejects genocide allegations, says South Africa misrepresented facts

THE HAGUE — Israel on Friday rejected allegations that it is committing genocide in Gaza, arguing before the International Court of Justice that the soaring death toll there is an unavoidable consequence of its battle against a militant army that has embedded itself in civilian areas.

In a hearing Thursday, South Africa said Israel’s bombing and siege of Gaza showed its “intent” to commit genocide against Palestinians and urged the court to order a stop to the violence.

In three hours of remarks on Friday, the Israeli delegation dismissed the plausibility of genocide in Gaza and argued against the orders requested by South Africa. Israel claimed that the South African case misrepresented facts and could put Israeli civilians at risk.

Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the court that Israel is “in a war it did not start and did not want. A war in which Israel is defending itself against Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist organizations whose brutality knows no bounds.”

This week’s hearings will not establish whether Israel has committed genocide. Rather, judges will assess South Africa’s call for provisional measures — interim steps aimed at stopping the situation in Gaza from deteriorating further while the case plays out.

On Thursday, Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, an Irish lawyer on the South African team, argued that the court should urgently order such measures. She cited the risk of “irreparable” harm to Palestinians in Gaza.

Omri Sender, representing the Israeli side, countered that the situation is not as urgent as South Africa suggested, noting that “the scope and intensity of the hostilities has been decreasing.”

Christopher Staker, also representing Israel, said South Africa’s call for provisional orders is unwarranted, prejudicial and would hand an advantage to Hamas, putting Israeli civilians at risk.

The International Court of Justice was established after World War II as a means to settle disputes between nations. In 1948, genocide was made a crime under international law, and the court was empowered to determine whether states have committed it.

The court’s rulings are legally binding but are hard to enforce. Legal analysts said it could be years before the court rules on this case, but a decision on provisional measures could come within weeks.

7:45 AM: No more Yemen strikes ‘immediately planned,’ U.K. minister says

British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said no further military action against Houthi rebels in Yemen is imminent after Thursday night’s strikes.

“We were confident that these limited, proportionate, necessary strikes that went in last night was necessary to disrupt the Houthis’ ability to attack our warships that are protecting shipping in the Red Sea,” he told “BBC Breakfast.”

Four British Typhoon jets joined the United States in hitting targets in Yemen overnight. They struck two sites, both of which had been used to launch drone and missile attacks, Heappey said, adding that further strikes were not “immediately planned.”

He defended Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to carry out the strikes without approval of Britain’s Parliament, saying that such decisions have to be made “based on the military, strategic and operational requirements.”

Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf is among those who have criticized the British leader for not consulting Parliament on the strikes.

6:50 AM: Palestinians say ICJ hearing makes them ‘feel seen for the first time’

JERUSALEM — For many Palestinians, the global airing of South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide in its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza was not just welcome as a chance to stem the violence that has killed tens of thousands. It was also a rare public reckoning of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory and policies they view as apartheid, they said.

“We feel seen for the first time,” said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian human rights lawyer and onetime adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. “It was no longer just Palestinians versus Israel; it was another state putting its diplomatic relations on the line to make the case.”

Supporters gathered in Nelson Mandela Square in Ramallah, the West Bank, on Thursday, waving Palestinian and South African flags after a South African legal team presented its arguments to the tribunal in The Hague. Social media came alive with celebratory postings.

The proceedings were big news in Israel, where detailed arguments against the military’s actions don’t always get a wide airing. Commentators mostly dismissed the legal case, saying it largely ignored the brutal Oct. 7 attacks that killed about 1,200 people and swept almost 250 hostages into Gaza, where more than 100 hostages are still thought to be held.

Buttu, who helped present a case against the separation barriers that Israel built to isolate West Bank communities, said a failure to issue an order curtailing military actions in Gaza would amount to a failure of the international legal system.

But even having the arguments laid out so methodically amounts to a milestone for Palestinians, she said.

“It’s already done something important,” she said. “This isn’t just about the genocide convention; it’s much broader than that.”

6:28 AM: Mixed global reaction to U.S., U.K. airstrikes in Yemen targeting Houthis

The announcement of U.S. and British strikes on Yemen’s Houthi militants, a group that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea in response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza , was met with a mixture of support, concern and condemnation around the globe.

In a joint statement , the governments of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States said Thursday’s action “demonstrated a shared commitment to freedom of navigation, international commerce, and defending the lives of mariners from illegal and unjustifiable attacks.”

Russia’s mission to the United Nations said on Telegram that it has requested an urgent meeting of the Security Council, which it expects to take place Friday afternoon.

Iran, which has avoided direct confrontation with the United States in the months since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack plunged the region into war, condemned the strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen as “a clear violation of Yemen’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” The intervention in Yemen, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said, was an attempt by the United States “to divert the attention of the people of the world” from the ongoing war in Gaza.

Saudi Arabia warned of the risks of escalation and said it is “closely monitoring” the situation in the Red Sea and inside Yemen “with great concern,” according to a Foreign Ministry statement . Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. partner in the region, is trying to conclude a peace deal with the Houthis and formally end its military intervention in Yemen’s long civil war.

Badr Albusaidi, the foreign minister of Oman, wrote on social media that the strikes in neighboring Yemen went “against our advice and will only add fuel to an extremely dangerous situation. I urge all parties to exercise restraint and focus on a ceasefire in Gaza now.”

In the United States, there was a mixed response from lawmakers.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) said in a statement that he was “pleased the president, in coordination with our allies, finally took action against the Iran-backed Houthis.” Others, including Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Val Hoyle (D-Ore.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) criticized President Biden for authorizing the strikes without congressional approval.

6:21 AM: Analysis from Emily Rauhala, Brussels bureau chief

Yesterday, South Africa argued that Israel is showing “genocidal intent” in the Gaza Strip. Today, the Israeli delegation is arguing that this intent does not exist, citing, among other things, phone calls and leafleting to warn Palestinians of incoming fire; evacuation orders; and food trucks entering Gaza.

5:01 AM: Israel argues South Africa’s case threatens its right to defend itself

THE HAGUE — Israel has started its three-hour presentation before the International Court of Justice in response to South Africa’s charges of genocide in Gaza. A lawyer for Israel, Tal Becker, focused on Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, including the murder of civilians and the taking of hostages.

Becker said Israel will highlight footage from that day because “it is impossible to understand the armed conflict in Gaza without understanding the nature of the threat Israel is facing.”

He argued that South Africa’s call for provisional measures to stop the violence in Gaza is a threat to Israel’s right to defend itself.

On Thursday, the South African delegation recognized Israel’s right to self-defense, but said the Israeli bombardment and siege of Gaza was disproportionate and showed “genocidal intent.”

“No matter how monstrous or appalling an attack or provocation, genocide is never a permitted response,” said Vaughan Lowe, a member of South Africa’s delegation.

The second day of hearings is now underway here in The Hague, with Israel set to deliver its three-hour response to South Africa’s claim that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

3:46 AM: Who are the Houthis, and why are they attacking ships in the Red Sea?

Houthi militants in Yemen have escalated attacks on ships traversing the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest waterways, drawing the ire of the United States, Britain and a coalition of countries invested in keeping the route open and safe for commerce. Since Israel declared war against Hamas in retaliation for its Oct. 7 cross-border attack, the Iranian-backed Houthis have used their base in northern Yemen to fire missiles and drones at several ships passing through the Red Sea.

The Houthis are a rebel movement that took control of Yemen’s capital in 2014. They are formally known as Ansar Allah, or the “partisans of God.” After deposing the U.S.-allied government in Sanaa, the Houthis forced then-President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia, elevating the group to international prominence and triggering a years-long civil war.

Here’s what to know about the Houthis.

3:44 AM: Israel to present defense in case at International Court of Justice

THE HAGUE — Israel will on Friday present its defense at the International Court of Justice , offering its counter to South Africa’s claims that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and must be stopped.

On Thursday, South African lawyers argued that Israel’s bombing and siege of Gaza showed a “genocidal intent” and called on the U.N. court to order Israel to stop the violence. To make their case, the South African delegation cited the words of senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Israel has categorically rejected South Africa’s allegations. On Friday, in three hours of presentations, the Israeli delegation is expected to argue that they are acting in self-defense following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and to show graphic video evidence from that day.

Critically, this week’s hearings will not assess whether Israeli has committed genocide. Instead, judges are weighing South Africa’s call for “provisional measures” to prevent further violence while the case plays out.

While any ruling on whether Israel’s actions amounted to genocide could take years, the court could rule on provisional measures within weeks, and could order Israel to change its conduct of the war, legal experts said. South Africa has focused on establishing the risk of genocide happening, and hence the obligation to prevent it.

The rare public reckoning for Israel is playing out under tight security in the Netherlands, with both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli assembling outside The Hague’s Peace Palace to rally support to their sides.

1:20 AM: U.S.-led coalition strikes Iran-aligned Houthi militants in Yemen

U.S. and coalition forces struck Iran-aligned Houthi militants in Yemen on Thursday, a dramatic escalation after the group ignored warnings from the Biden administration and other governments to stop attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea.

The operation follows weeks of hostility as the Houthis, protesting Israel’s military campaign in Gaza , have disrupted global trade by making the vital waterway a dangerous place for ships to transit. The group, which functions as the de-facto government in parts of Yemen, has carried out numerous attacks since November, officials have said, leading to repeated distress calls and routine altercations with U.S. and partner nations’ warships dispatched to the region in response.

Senior U.S. officials have blamed Iran for having “aided and abetted” the crisis, saying the Houthis would be incapable of threatening the shipping route if not for Tehran’s technological and intelligence support.

Examining the Potential Repercussions of a Houthi Retaliation Against American Forces

The query posed appears to be rooted in concerns over the escalation of hostilities following recent U.S. military strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. This interest likely stems from the Houthi threat to international shipping lanes and the broader implications of further destabilization in the Middle East. It is imperative to analyze the potential ramifications of a Houthi retaliation and the intricate balance of power in this volatile region.

Yemen has been embroiled in a complex conflict, with the Houthi movement—a group believed to be backed by Iran—playing a significant role. The recent strikes by U.S. and British forces in Yemen represent a stark escalation and a global concern due to the strategic importance of the Red Sea as a commercial shipping route. The Houthis have demonstrated their capacity to disrupt this vital maritime passage, thus heightening tensions and raising questions about potential countermeasures.

Should the Houthis decide to retaliate against American forces, several scenarios could unfold. The immediate effect would likely involve an intensification of regional conflicts, broadening the participation of various state and non-state actors. The Houthis have previously shown their capability to launch sophisticated attacks, including the use of drones and missiles, which suggests that American military assets in the region could be at risk. A direct attack on U.S. interests or allies would lead to an almost certain response, potentially drawing the United States deeper into the Yemeni conflict.

Another critical aspect to consider is the role of Iran. As alleged supporters of the Houthi movement, Iranian actions will be closely scrutinized. Any evidence of direct Iranian involvement in a Houthi retaliation could exacerbate already strained U.S.-Iran relations and might jeopardize the delicate negotiations surrounding Iran's nuclear program and regional security matters.

On the international stage, such a conflict has the potential to draw in other global powers, all of whom have vested interests in the stability of Middle East. With multiple actors, including the United Nations and the European Union, calling for de-escalation, a retaliatory strike by the Houthis could disrupt concerted diplomatic efforts to bring about a resolution to the Yemeni conflict. Moreover, it could lead to increased calls for resilience in international trade logistics, including a reevaluation of shipping routes and the defense of maritime lines of communication.

Economically, a cycle of retaliation is likely to cause disruptions in global markets—particularly in the energy sector—as the Red Sea region is critical for oil and gas shipments. The recent strikes and subsequent Red Sea tensions have already impacted commercial entities, with both Tesla and Volvo having to adjust production schedules due to supply chain complications. A tit-for-tat escalation could thus have far-reaching ramifications, exacerbating supply chain woes and potentially leading to a surge in global energy prices.

For the populations of Yemen and the broader Middle East, the prospect of continued military engagements portends worsening humanitarian conditions. Yemen, already devastated by years of war, faces the real possibility of further suffering and displacement of citizens should the conflict flare anew.

In summation, a Houthi retaliation could provoke a multifaceted crisis involving military, political, economic, and humanitarian dimensions. It is imperative for all involved stakeholders to approach the situation with caution, recognizing that any actions taken will have consequences that reverberate beyond Yemen's borders, impacting international security, economic stability, and the quest for regional peace.
