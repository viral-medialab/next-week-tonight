The article discusses President Trump's tariff policies and their substantial impact on global trade and the economy. Key highlights include:

- **Introduction of Sweeping Tariffs:** President Trump has recently implemented a 10% tariff on all trading partners and sharply increased tariffs on certain countries like China, where rates now exceed 104%. This has significantly escalated trade tensions.
- **Economic Impact:** The new tariffs have increased the effective tariff rate on U.S. imports to over 23%, marking the largest tax increase in decades. This policy is expected to generate nearly $400 billion in revenue but poses risks of slowing economic growth and increasing inflation.
- **Recession Risks:** The measures are projected to reduce U.S. GDP growth by 1.3% and have already led to downgrades in global growth forecasts, signaling an increased likelihood of a U.S. and global recession in 2025.
- **Market Reactions:** Global markets have reacted strongly, with increased volatility and risk-off sentiment. The tariffs have triggered depreciation of currencies like the Chinese yuan and have disrupted supply chains globally.
- **Policy Developments:** The article notes a pause in escalating tariffs on most countries, except for China, providing temporary relief. Meanwhile, the European Union has delayed its countermeasures in hopes of negotiating a resolution.

This ongoing situation underscores the uncertainties surrounding trade policies and their far-reaching implications for both domestic and international markets. J.P. Morgan advises investors to adopt diversified and resilient portfolio strategies to navigate these turbulent conditions.
