The plain text from the article at the requested URL (Harvard Business Review) is not available for extraction. However, based on the summary provided in the search results, here is a detailed summary of the article:

On April 2, 2025, President Trump implemented significant tariff increases, raising the average effective tariff rate on U.S. imports to approximately 23%, which marked nearly a tenfold increase from the previous year. This dramatic policy shift caused sharp selloffs in financial markets, reflecting global uncertainty and raising concerns about sweeping macroeconomic impacts. 

The article emphasizes that these new tariffs represent a complex economic shock, with both direct and indirect effects on supply, demand, and broader economic trends. Direct effects include increased costs for imported goods, which are likely to drive up inflation and reduce real income for households. Knock-on effects, like disruptions in global supply chains and retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, may further exacerbate economic challenges.

Executives and policymakers are now grappling with how to adapt to these rapid changes, as the situation remains fluid. For instance, on April 9, reciprocal tariffs were temporarily paused for most countries (except China) to allow for potential negotiations. This underscores a strategy of "deliberate uncertainty," where the administration uses unpredictability as a tool in trade negotiations.

The article also highlights how these tariffs could reshape global trade dynamics and create ripple effects in financial markets and economic activity across multiple sectors and countries.
