The plain text of the article "The Economic Effects of President Trump's Tariffs" from the Penn Wharton Budget Model website is not available for extraction. However, here is a summary of the article based on the provided information:

President Trump's tariffs, imposed as of April 2025, include a minimum 10% tariff on all U.S. imports alongside higher tariffs (ranging between 11% and 50%) on imports from 57 specific countries. These tariffs are projected to have significant economic consequences:

- **GDP and Wage Impact**: The tariffs are expected to reduce U.S. GDP by approximately 8% and wages by 7%. A middle-income household is estimated to face a $58,000 lifetime loss, which is double the economic harm compared to an equivalent corporate tax increase.
- **Revenue Effects**: The tariffs could generate $5.2 trillion over 10 years on a strict conventional basis and $4.2 trillion on a partially dynamic basis. While raising significant revenue, the tariffs have a more severe impact on economic activity than traditional tax increases.
- **Economic Declines**: The broader economic implications include reduced international capital flows, a diminished demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, and increased domestic bond purchases. These tariffs lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers, destabilizing economic activity.
- **Price Increases and Policy Uncertainty**: Tariffs act as a tax on imports, raising prices for goods and creating uncertainty that discourages investment, hiring, and consumption decisions. By April 2025, economic policy uncertainty had doubled since January of the same year, contributing to an estimated 4.4% reduction in investment for 2025.

Overall, the analysis concludes that the tariffs cause widespread economic harm, impacting GDP, household incomes, and the global trading system, with potential long-term repercussions for U.S. economic competitiveness and resilience.
