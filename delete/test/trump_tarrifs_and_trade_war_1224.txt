The White House's fact sheet, dated April 2, 2025, outlines President Donald J. Trump's declaration of a national emergency to address foreign trade practices deemed harmful to U.S. economic and national security. Key points include:

- **National Emergency Declaration**: President Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose responsive tariffs, citing persistent trade deficits and non-reciprocal trade practices as threats to national security.
  
- **Tariff Measures**:
  - A 10% baseline tariff applies to all imports, effective April 5, 2025.
  - Additional reciprocal tariffs, ranging higher than 10%, are directed at countries with significant trade deficits with the U.S., effective April 9, 2025.
  - These tariffs are intended to remain until the trade deficit issues are resolved.

- **Rationale**:
  - The U.S. is facing over $1.2 trillion in trade deficits (as of 2024), which has weakened domestic manufacturing, critical supply chains, and the defense-industrial base.
  - Trade practices such as currency manipulation, unequal tariffs, and other non-tariff barriers by foreign partners have been highlighted as contributors to the deficits.

- **Economic Sovereignty and Security**: The administration argues that these actions will protect American jobs, incentivize domestic production, reduce foreign dependency, and strengthen both economic and national security.

- **Impact of Tariffs**:
  - Studies cited in the fact sheet suggest that tariffs can create economic growth, job creation, and incentives for reshoring production to the U.S. while having minimal inflationary impacts.

Overall, this move is framed by the Trump administration as a critical step to rebalance trade relationships, reduce dependency on foreign adversaries, and prioritize American manufacturing and security interests.
