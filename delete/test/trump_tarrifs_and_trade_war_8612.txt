The Tax Foundation analyzed the economic impact of tariffs introduced during the Trump administration. Key findings include:

- Tariffs will generate $2.2 trillion in revenue over a decade but reduce U.S. GDP by 0.8% before accounting for foreign retaliation, which further reduces GDP by 0.2%, totaling a long-run GDP reduction of 1.0%.
- American households will face higher costs due to tariffs, leading to an average tax increase of almost $1,300 per household for 2025 and a 1.3% reduction in after-tax income.
- The tariffs, including the "reciprocal" ones introduced on April 2, 2025, target a wide range of goods and trading partners, such as 10% universal tariffs with additional duties on certain imports from China (reaching up to 145%).
- Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum were expanded while exemptions were reduced, meaning that more imports are now subject to these tariffs at increased rates (e.g., aluminum tariffs raised from 10% to 25%).
- The impact of both U.S.-imposed tariffs and retaliatory tariffs will likely burden American firms and consumers, who bear most of the economic repercussions.

The report emphasizes that the policy has led to higher prices, reduced economic output, and significant costs to U.S. businesses and consumers while failing to alleviate trade imbalances effectively.
