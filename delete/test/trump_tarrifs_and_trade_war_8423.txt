The article provides an analysis of the cumulative economic and distributional impacts of U.S. tariffs enacted in 2025, including key measures from April 2, 2025. The average effective U.S. tariff rate reached 22.5%, the highest since 1909. Key findings include:

- **Economic Impact**: The tariffs collectively reduce U.S. real GDP growth by 0.9 percentage points for 2025 and result in a persistently smaller economy by 0.6% ($180 billion annually) in the long term. Unemployment rises by 0.5 percentage points, with payroll employment 600,000 lower.

- **Price Level and Consumer Costs**: These tariffs raise the overall price level by 2.3% in the short term, costing the average household $3,800 annually (in 2024 dollars). Low-income households bear a disproportionate burden, with annual losses of $1,700.

- **Commodity-Specific Effects**: Price increases are especially pronounced for clothing and textiles (up 33%), along with food prices, which rise by 4.5%.

- **Fiscal Impact**: The tariffs, including foreign retaliation, are projected to raise $3 trillion in revenue over 2026-2035, though $588 billion of this will be offset by negative dynamic effects on tax revenue.

The tariffs represent regressive taxation, affecting lower-income households more severely as a percentage of income. In the long run, while the burden becomes more evenly distributed, both labor income and capital returns are reduced. The findings underscore the broad economic disruption caused by these policies, including impacts on employment, prices, and economic growth.
