The article "Tariffs Work — and President Trump's First Term Proves It," published on April 2, 2025, on the White House website, outlines the positive economic impacts of tariffs implemented during President Trump's first term. Below is a summary of the key points covered in the article:

1. **Economic Benefits of Tariffs**:
   - The tariffs implemented during President Trump's first term, particularly on steel and aluminum imports, were credited with creating thousands of jobs in the metals industry and increasing wages.
   - A 2024 study concluded that these tariffs strengthened the U.S. economy and encouraged reshoring in industries such as manufacturing and steel production.
   - Steel and aluminum imports decreased significantly, falling by nearly one-third between 2016 and 2020.

2. **Boost to Domestic Production and Investment**:
   - The tariffs stimulated domestic production of affected goods and prompted over $10 billion in investments for building new steel mills.
   - U.S. steel producers announced plans to invest more than $15.7 billion in new or upgraded facilities, creating around 3,200 new jobs.

3. **Insignificant Impact on Consumer Prices**:
   - According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs had no correlation with inflation and caused only temporary effects on overall prices.
   - Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen supported the notion that tariffs do not lead to significant consumer price increases.

4. **Broader Economic Gains**:
   - An economic analysis projected that a global 10% tariff could grow the U.S. economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and raise real household incomes by 5.7%.
   - The tariffs were described as incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase American-made goods.

5. **Strategic and Regional Impacts**:
   - Tariffs were deemed a "boon" for regions like Minnesota, where the iron ore industry benefited significantly.
   - The policy contributed to bolstering national security by lessening dependency on foreign supply chains.

6. **Trade Deficit and Protection of Domestic Industries**:
   - The measures sought to address the chronic trade deficit and promote fair trade practices, emphasizing the importance of reciprocity in global trade relationships.

The article underscores President Trump’s belief in tariffs as an effective strategy to protect American industries, create jobs, and ensure economic sovereignty while addressing trade imbalances. It draws on various studies, reports, and industry analyses to substantiate the argument for the economic and strategic benefits of the tariff policies.
