### **Summary of the Fiscal and Economic Effects of Revised April 9 Tariffs**
The Budget Lab at Yale reviewed the effects of all US tariffs and retaliatory measures implemented in 2025 up to April 9, including the newly revised tariffs on China and other trading partners.

#### **Key Findings:**
1. **Tariff Rates:**
   - The overall average effective tariff rate reached 27%, the highest since 1903. After accounting for consumption shifts, the adjusted tariff rate is 18.5%, the highest since 1933.

2. **Price Levels and Economic Impact:**
   - All 2025 tariffs increased the price level by 2.9% in the short term. This translated into an average consumer loss of $4,700 per household in 2024 dollars.
   - After consumer substitution, the price increase settled at 1.7%, still amounting to a $2,700 loss per household.
   - Clothing and textiles were disproportionately impacted, with apparel prices surging 64% in the short term and remaining 27% higher in the longer term.

3. **GDP and Labor Market Effects:**
   - Real GDP growth in the US for 2025 was projected to decline by 1.1 percentage points.
   - In the long term, the economy is estimated to be 0.6% smaller annually, equating to a $170 billion loss (in 2024 dollars).
   - The unemployment rate is expected to rise by 0.6 percentage points by the end of 2025, with payroll employment reduced by 740,000 jobs.

4. **Fiscal Effects:**
   - The tariffs are expected to generate $2.4 trillion in revenue over the period of 2026-2035 under conventional scoring methods.
   - Dynamic effects, such as reduced output, are anticipated to result in additional revenue losses amounting to $587 billion.

5. **Policy Changes on April 9:**
   - The “reciprocal” tariff rate announced on April 2 was suspended for 90 days. During this period, a 10% minimum tariff applied universally, except for China.
   - For China, tariffs were increased significantly, with rates reaching up to 145% for certain imports.

#### **Distributional Impact:**
- Tariffs were found to be regressive, disproportionately impacting lower-income households. Families at the bottom decile faced annual losses averaging $2,100, compared to $3,700 for middle-income households and $10,000 for the top decile.

The report reflects the significant economic challenges posed by these tariffs, including heightened consumer costs, economic contraction, and labor market disturbances.
